Like all things truly Jersey, 077XX makes the most in balancing through its accentuation of extremes. Inspired by the west coast IPAs we love, we added a thump of hops to a dynamic malt profile and chose a yeast to drive these two further than they wanted to go. Throw our water into this mix and you will find dank green resinous hops popping over orange, mango and papaya aromas, with just enough sweetness of body to make the long finish a pleasure to have around. Drink 0’Dub when your night matters."

(Previously known as Hop God) A beautiful golden crossbreed of a Belgian Tripel and a West Coast IPA. A remarkable explosion on the palate with spiciness, tropical fruit, and a firm citrus bitterness that will leave you begging for more! Aromas of grapefruit, citrus, and piney hops & tastes on the palate that tend toward pineapple, mango, and sweeter fruits. A big beer that was inspired by the West Coast – yet brewed by a Midwestern brewery not content with the status quo."

Parabajava,Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,4.54,#107,108,848,6.17%,430,172,23,California,Russian Imperial Stout,14.00%,Rotating,"
Parabajava ia an ongoing series exploring the infusion of coffee into our Parabola Barrel Aged Imperial Series. This first offering is a collaboration with the famed Intelligentsia Coffee Company, utilizing their El Diablo espresso blend. This beer was crated for our June 16th Father’s Day brunch at Lot 213 in L.A. The coffee brings intense coffee house espress aroma - roasty carmel, toffee, molasses and fresh ground coffee notes. The flavor melds well with the big rich character of the stout - complementary roasty flavors, dark baker’s chocolate, and more caramel which pairs well with Parabola’s rich malt and smokey oak bourbon notes. The finish is amazingly smooth and integrated."

Red Rock's Elephino (el-uh-fine-oh) Double India Pale Ale is an American style IPA. Its intense citrus, floral and perfume-like, resinous and piney aroma come from the use of a copious amount of American hops.

To Øl / Mikkeller Overall IIPA,To Øl,4.08,"#5,742",44,89,10.05%,6,7,1,Denmark,American Imperial IPA,10.50%,Rotating,"
One of two sequels to the Mikkeller/To Øl collab “Overall IIPA”. The same beer base as Overall, but this time cleverly refermented with wild yeast (Primarily brettanomyces). The tart, funky and odorous aromas of the brett interact with the fruity and bitter palate of the IIPA and results in somewhat of a hybrid beer. This beer might be a reference to some Belgian classic, but you have to figure it out yourself…"
E.,Hill Farmstead Brewery,4.29,"#1,085",87,582,7.69%,319,73,7,Vermont,Belgian Saison,7.00%,Rotating,"
E is definitely not a Belgian IPA - it's a funky version of Edward (american pale ale) - fermented with brettanomyces, dry hopped with galaxy, and aged on stainless for four months. Basically, we refer to it as a farmhouse pale ale - a cross between a saison and an american pale."

We first released this decidedly indelicate beer in 2012, as Stone Ruination Tenth Anniversary IPA, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our belovedly bitter Stone Ruination IPA. Stone RuinTen IPA uses the same recklessly hoppy recipe as the 2012 release; only the name has changed, as we plan to unleash this belligerently delicious hop monster upon the public annually from now on. We packed a whopping five pounds of hops into each barrel, and cranked up the ABV to stand up to the hop onslaught. The results are glorious, and we know you'll rejoice in tasting this audacious gem of hoppy splendor once again. You're welcome."

Schneider version. This brew is the result of the long friendship of Brooklyn brewmaster Garrett Oliver and Schneider brewmaster Hans-Peter Drexler. Garrett had always admired the delicate balance of flavors in Schneider Weisse, while Hans-Peter had long enjoyed the effusive hop character of Brooklyn East India Pale Ale and BLAST! Garrett's concept for the collaboration was that each brewmaster would brew essentially the same pale, hoppy weissbock in the other's brewery, but with different hopping to reflect the local hop flavor."

A rich, full bodied Barley Wine with a wonderfully warming character from the malts & dark brown sugars. Held to the light, its burgundy color is fitting for a bigger beer that has aromatics that hint of the oak, the whiskey, the somewhat sweet nature, and molasses that makes this beer truly unique. The non-barrel-aged version of this beer took Silver in the 2009 US Open Beer Championships. Using Stranahan’s Whiskey barrels, we aged this beer for 6 months to impart a small amount of oak tannins and the whiskey character that combine to elevate this beer beyond its original entry into this world. Excellent to enjoy now and cellerable for years."

Absurd amounts of the big West Coast hops gives this beer its citrusy, weedy nose and big, dank flavor. We dry hop with 48lbs per batch, which is over 3lbs of hops per barrel. In keeping with the classic style of the West Coast double, sugar plays a large part in creating this dry and minimally bitter double IPA. The Freak is particularly pintable for the style, so if you dare to enter, we welcome you to the Freak Show."

It has been said that the only constant is change and the same is true for barrel-aged beers. Cut from a similar recipe, this barrel-aged Quad evolves and shows a different face each year; a result of time spent aging in the barrel. Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico adds wonderful molasses flavors that are reminiscent of Belgian candi sugar. It has a full body and lush texture with barrel expression all over; toasted oak, coconut, leather and rich cigar tobacco."

Lets just say he won’t be that jerk that leaves you at the bar at 2am. He’s low in alcohol. What a nice guy… that Hubert."

Bright was created to be a clean and elegant showcase for one of our favorite hops - Mosaic! It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Bright’s aroma is a cornucopia of citrus dank… The taste follows suit with notes of grapefruit, sweet berries, and clementine with a gentle orange rind finish. She is dry, soft, deceptively juicy and adequately bittered resulting in a very approachable yet pungent Double IPA. We hope you find this bit of a departure as enjoyable as we do!"

Mosaic IPA,Community Beer Company,4.18,"#2,454",83,714,9.57%,74,267,1,Texas,American IPA,8.60%,Year-round,"
The deep golden/light amber color of this IPA comes from the use of a blend of English Maris Otter and American pale base malts. Sparing use of English crystal malt lends some caramel sweetness to help balance the hefty bitterness. Heady aromas of blueberry, pine, citrus and tropical fruit are the result of blending Mosaic hops with several other delicious American hop varieties. For being a large, hoppy beer it is quite drinkable, in part due to the balancing act of alcohol, malt complexity, and enormous American hop character."

Impermanence is an imperial milk stout brewed with coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup. Below these additions lies a complex base of chocolate, caramel, and dark crystal malts. A kettle addition of lactose serves to amplify the decadence of this uniquely Tree House offering. Impermanence coats the tongue with flavors of sweet milk chocolate, dark amber maple syrup, and coffee ice cream. It's an incredible treat - a bona fide breakfast confections bonanza. It is an example of what is possible with careful selection of ingredients paired with focused brewing execution. Please enjoy it fresh and use it as an opportunity to reflect, give thanks, and enjoy in the company of others."

dHop 2 is a 8.5% DIPA that investigates the interplay between our ale strain and an intensive Mosaic and Citra forward hop bill woven four times into its creative process.

This beer exemplifies the best Upstream has to offer. It is the same beer as the Tripel, but the special Belgian yeast (the same yeast responsible for the unique character found in Burgundy wines) added during maturation lends a distinct earthy character to the beer.

Custer’s Last Stout is a Foreign-Style stout. It has an initial malt sweetness and chocolate flavor with a dry roasted bitterness finish. It is brewed with English malted barley and domestic Fuggle hops. This variety of hop adds a slight herbal (licorice) aroma and flavor to our stout. Foreign-Style stouts originated when English breweries added more hops and alcohol to their classic dry stouts as a natural preservative. They did this so the beer would survive the long journey to their far reaching empire around the world."

Florence (1915-1967) was our grandfather’s sister, and Hill Farmstead Brewery rests upon the land that was once home to her and her 13 siblings. In her honor, this Belgian inspired Wheat ale is crafted from American malted barley, Organic Vermont wheat, European and American hops, our distinctive farmhouse yeast and water from our well. It is unfiltered and naturally carbonated. Soft, cloudy, and fresh, this is the ale that I dream to have shared with Florence. Florence becomes....Flora(Barrel aged Wheat Saison) is our Wheat Saison (Florence), brewed with Butterworks Farm Organic Vermont Winter Wheat, aged for 8 to 14 months in French Oak wine barrels and complimented by the terroir of our resident microflora...

Hefe is the German word for yeast and weizen is wheat, making this beer style fairly self-explanatory. The classic banana and clove-like flavors are derived from a specific Bavarian yeast. Because the beer is unfiltered, these dynamic yeasty flavors come through strongly. There is merely a hint of hop flavor added so as not to compete with the yeast notes. Some drinkers (not all) enjoy a squeeze of lemon."

Allagash Ghoulschip is our version of a pumpkin beer. We brewed it, on Halloween 2008, with a monster mash that included shredded Maine pumpkin and toasted pumpkin seeds. After much toil and some trouble, molasses were added to the boil. The wort then spent the night outside, in our Coolship, possessed by the yeasts of beers past. In the morning, the cooled wort was racked into a stainless tank and pitched with our house yeast. After primary fermentation the beer is then transferred to oak barrels. Ghoulschip fermented and aged in the dark recesses of our cellars for almost three years. The resulting beer is light bodied and pumpkiny in color. Apricot dominates the aroma, with vanilla and caramel lurking in the background. The flavor profile is scarily clean, with a dry, tart finish that will haunt you. Boo."

It’s worth the risk to go for Double Jeopardy IPA. This complex and easy drinking imperial IPA pours a hazy golden orange with a fluffy, stark white foam that dissipates to moderate lacing -- proof of the crime of an empty glass. The aroma floods the senses with bright citrus and New World tropical flavors led by Simcoe hops. Double Jeopardy has a malty bite up front from caramel and pale malts followed by a resinous hoppy middle, then finishes with a lingering, bittersweet boozy tingle. This big and bold unfiltered IPA taunts you: Can you walk away without having another? "

Easy drinking yet always satisfying."

The holiday season has a way of stirring up nostalgia. In late 2012, we brewed King Julius on our original Brew Magic brewing system - a whole ten gallons of it! Despite the size of the batch, the memory of it is enormous in our hearts. The thought of it brings us back to our cozy Brimfield barn, with the wood stove cranking, the record player spinning, Santa Dean mulling about, and Lauren and Kim filling growlers out of a modified chest freezer in a small nook under a wooden staircase. As we continue to move forward in our journey it felt like the perfect time to pay homage to our beginnings. King Julius is our endeavor to marry our past with what we aspire to be in the future. King Julius is an American Double IPA brewed to be an exceptionally flavorful, juicy, and hop saturated beer while never tiring the palate. It’s vivid citrus aromas give way to flavors of orange creamsicle, mango smoothie, and a bounty of fresh tropical fruit. We find it to be supremely soft in the midst of an onslaught of flavor. . . A beer we are quite proud of."

A tradition that is as old as Dean at this point, we have brewed a big old batch of Double Shot that features a huge blend of beans from all of our favorite roasters. The result is a beer that is dark, fudgy, mysterious, and a mess of delicious coffee flavors from rich milk chocolate to smoke and caramel. It is perhaps the most intriguing and complex base Anniversary Double Shot in memory, and has us curious and intrigued what a blend of five or more coffees can do in the future. This is one of our very favorite beers any time of the year, and a beer that, with its unique presentation, mouthfeel, and flavor saturation, is unique to Tree House. Here it is rich yet powerful, and intense yet enjoyable. Enjoy."

Bourbon Street Stout is an Imperial Stout that is aged in small batch bourbon barrels. Our Imperial Stout is brewed with a combination of pale, caramel, chocolate and roasted malts. Oats are also added to give the beer a fuller and sweeter taste. The roasted malts give the beer its dark color as well as its intense flavor and aroma. After fermentation the beer is cold aged for 6 weeks. This is necessary for all of the flavors of the malt and hops to balance and produce a very smooth flavor."

The added layer of oak leaves a perception of dryness to balance this big, malty finish."

Originating in the farmhouses of Wallonia in the French speaking region of Belgium, Saison (French, ""season"") was brewed for field workers during the harvest season. Red Rock is proud to present a modern version of this once endangered style of beer.

Blimey That's Bitter!,Reuben's Brews,4.3,"#1,463",15,90,8.37%,19,6,0,Washington,American Imperial IPA,10.50%,Rotating,"
An Intense citrus, pine and tropical aroma are followed by a smooth medium full mouth feel. First brewed in early 2014, Blimey That's Bitter has become a loved brew! Using ludicrous amounts of hops - about 6lbs per barrel - we focus on hop flavor and aroma, with 90% of these hop additions are in the last 10 minutes of the boil and later."
Super Typhoon,Tree House Brewing Company,4.41,-,37,202,6.58%,10,43,2,Massachusetts,American Imperial IPA,7.70%,Limited (brewed once),"
Super Typhoon is a rendition of Hurricane that features amplified additions of Simcoe and Citra in both the kettle and the dry hop. Additionally, process modifications make for a fuller bodied base beer capable of absorbing the additional hop charges without becoming abrasive or astringent. The result is perhaps our favorite amalgamation of hops in our short history. We taste heavy notes of tropical fruit and passion fruit from the Simcoe blending seamlessly with orange sherbet notes from the Citra. An airy mouthfeel and a creamy body makes for a beer that never becomes burdensome to drink, and gets better as you move through the glass. We are excited to share it with you."

In honor of the 40th anniversary of the original release of Bitches Brew, Miles Davis' 1970 paradigm-shifting landmark fusion breakthrough, we've created our own Bitches Brew -- a bold, dark beer that's a fusion of three threads of imperial stout and one thread of honey beer with gesho root.

What do Swedes love almost as much as a juicy double IPAs? Apparently, David Hasselhoff as JC learned during his summer visit to Stockholm. Photos of The Hoff were plastered throughout the brewery for the collaboration brew, which invoked powerful memories of JC's 'favorite' Hoff photo... one where he is strategically ""covered"" in puppies. After sharing this photo with the Omnipollo crew, everyone immediately agreed this would be name of the Double IPA we were brewing."

Much like how Regular Coffee looks to evoke Jersey’s version of an acidic, bitter coffee curbed by milk and sugar, Caffé Corretto takes a lesson from our Italian friends by running a touch of anise’s bitter-to-sweet path alongside coffee’s.

It’s always best to take a quill pig seriously, and that’s just what this Czech-style pilsner expects. Golden-hued like fields of waving wheat, this medium-bodied beer has sweet biscuit-like maltiness paired with spicy, floral hop aromas poking out from Czech Saaz hops. It pours with an admirable head and sticks nicely to the sides of the glass (lacing). Remember, quill pigs don’t make good pets, but they do make good pilsners."

The closest an ale can legally be to wine! With 51% of the fermentable sugars coming from grain and 49% coming from grapes, Mixed Media is a complex saison-esque ale brewed with a distinct Belgian yeast strain. Using a late-harvest Viognier grape must from our friends at Alexandria Nicole Cellars in Washington, you'll find notes of white grape and melon in the aroma, and greeted with a spicy white wine body in every sip. As our newest spin in the beer-wine world, Mixed Media appeals to both the Pinot Gris and beer drinker alike with a crisp, dry and tart ale that will leave you 'puckering' for more."

The beer was then transferred into mead barrels, from Vermont mead maker Artesano, and aged an additional 8 months. The finished beer is copper in color with a complex aroma including oak, dill and stone fruit.

The art and science of brewing continues to captivate us - every opportunity to experiment in search of how to improve our beer, and to further our understanding of what ultimately makes a beer enjoyable, enriches our spirit! Curiosity Forty Eight is revival of the Curiosity Thirty Two recipe with a number of refinements to the base beer and a hop dosing rate that is vastly increased in both the kettle and the dry hop. The result is a beer that is dripping with fruity hop saturation akin to some of our favorite big Tree House double IPA’s. We taste ripe citrus, overripe mango, peach, and pineapple. A tight carbonation seems to disappear on the tongue enticing your palate for the next sip. A frothy head and bright orange color contribute to the tremendous appeal of this beer."

Eleventh in our ongoing series of experimental stout blends, this version of Madness and Civilization is constructed with a few barrels of two-year-old Damon (brewed with honey) and a larger quantity of an imperial stout brewed in honor of batch 1,000. Batch 1,000 (or 1k, as we refer to it), is a 33º American-style sweet imperial stout that spent more than a year in bourbon barrels. The beers were then married on organic Ecuadorian cacao nibs and organic Ethiopian coffee beans before packaging. After a satisfactory period of bottle conditioning, the beer is ready for release."

Brewing is the craft of blending science with artistry then introducing the mystical. Field to Ferment exempliﬁes this adventure. We will brew this fresh hop ale throughout the entire hop harvest in Yakima using each of four hop varieties as they are harvested. At least that’s the plan. Nature may have a different plan. Such is the harvest. Each can has a date and brew number stamped on the bottom; check FremontBrewing.com for the exact hops used in your beer. In order of harvest, we will brew with fresh Centennial, Simcoe,™ Citra,™ and ﬁnally Mosaic™ hops. Field to Ferment represents a colossal collaboration between the brewery and our hop farmers. No one has attempted to brew fresh hop beers throughout the entire season. We will make countless trips between the ﬁelds in Yakima and the brewery in Fremont, loaded with tens of thousands of pounds of fresh, juicy hops. Nothing is fresher, nothing is better for a brewer. So, please do enjoy this beer absolutely fresh, and enjoy the adventure this beer represents…Because Fresh Hop Beer Matters! “Fresh hops are the best hops.” – VWP"

Freestyle Pilsner,Santa Fe Brewing Company,3.67,"#30,632",51,171,13.35%,5,22,1,New Mexico,German Pilsner,5.50%,Summer,"
As its name suggests, this Pilsner does not like to be categorized. Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to “the original” pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hop’s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Company’s line up."

I think that in the life of every brewer exists a particular moment that makes him proud and satisfied with his work: for me this time comes during the blend of La Luna Rossa. Maybe because it is the beer that it takes more time before leaving the brewery, or maybe for a certain analogy with the trade of enologist, it is always very emotional when myself and Luca (a solid presence at the brewery) find ourselves between sour splashes and leftover pieces of fruit that remind me the “visciole” (morello cherry) my grandfather used to eat while playng cards. It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling."
Northeast IPA,Kiitos Brewing,4.19,-,3,10,4.3%,0,0,0,Utah,New England IPA,7.30%,Rotating,"
Just like the venerable atlantic salmon swims against the current, the Kiitos Northeastern India Pale Ale prides itself on being the antithesis to the traditional IPA. We chose salmon to represent this unique brew because Finland’s River Teno produces more atlantic salmon catches than any other river in the world. And we think our Northeastern India Pale Ale, known for it’s restrained bitterness and heightened hop aromas, is a pretty good thing to catch in it’s own right."

Cuvée des Jacobins Rouge is a Flemish Sour Ale, red in color with a beguiling balance of malty sweetness and acidic sharpness. It is made from spontaneously fermented and barrel-aged beer of at least 18 months in age. The beer is cooled overnight in a large, shallow metal vessel called a coolship and then fermented and aged in large oak foudres which are made in France and assembled on-site at Bockor."

Only the beers from the city of Köln, Germany are allowed to be called Kölsch. While most German beers are lagers, Kölsch is one of the few German ales. This beer is light in color and quenching, very mild in hop character. This is a signature beer of Chris Erickson. The recipe was written after returning from a trip overseas visiting our German brewer friend Guido Waldecker and is named in his honor. Guido's Kölnerbrau has an alcohol content of 4.9%."

The concept of Morality is perhaps a subjective one, as the history of alcohol in Quebec may demonstrate. This IPA is brewed with a dare-we-say excessive quantity of Simcoe, Citra and Centennial hops. The dry finish is highly aromatic and slightly resinous, invoking tropical fruits atop dominant hop bitterness."

Emulating the lagers of the German city of Dortmund, this beer is golden, light and refreshing. Though this beer is light in color, it is still full in flavor and very thirst quenching.

This beer is our take on classic Belgian sour beers from the Senne Valley. We combine Colorado pilsner malt and raw wheat with a hefty charge of aged European whole hops and boil for almost 3 hours. We ferment in a variety of different sized oak barrels with a proprietary blend of saccharomyces, brettanomyces and various lactic acid bacteria cultures. After aging in these barrels for anywhere from 9-12 months, barrels are selected for their unique flavors and that individual blend is born."

Our dark wheat beer is impressive with its creamy white foam. A fruity-fresh sweetness and hints of mature bananas harmonise with delicious flavours of roasted malt, sparkling and full-bodied with a light caramel taste on the first sip.

Brewer's Notes: Baird Natsumikan Ale is brewed with whirlpool additions of ample quantities of freshly peeled and stomped natsumikans that were grown in the Heda orchard of our good friend Nagakura-san. Natsumikans are grapefruit-like both in appearance (large, round, yellowish orange) and in flavor (tart and sweetly sour). The tart natsumikan flavor is supported by a big, sweetly malty wort base that is accentuated by a high mashing temperature. Additional citrus and floral notes are provided by an All-American lineup of hops: Simcoe, Horizon and Mount Hood. ABV is approximately 5.4-6.0%."

Tongue Extinguisher is our PermaCursed Double IPA. Constructed atop a subtle malt base of all 2 Row barley. Hopped and dry hopped intensely with hyper fresh Nelson Sauvin and Simcoe... both hand selected by our team in New Zealand and Yakima. I believe that this was our first “pungent and drippy juicy” Double IPA that we first brewed in July of 2013 at our humble #BrewCafé. We originally brewed this beer in an attempt to explore the outer edges of what “extreme” meant to us back then...Man... the more things change, the more they stay the same! This batch is ripping with notes of tropical pineapple smoothie, ripe gooseberry, sappy evergreen, sunny time Lemon Kush, and drippy champagne mango."

Thirty miles north of Barrelworks lies the fertile Santa Maria Valley. Its warm days and cool marine layer-fed evenings allow for a cornucopia of fruits and vegetables to be grown in its rich soil. One of Santa Maria’s crown jewels is locally grown raspberries. We jumped at the opportunity to ferment fresh local raspberries with one of our Barrelworks creations. Behold Bretta Rosé! A low-alcohol Berliner Weisse style ale, acidified and matured in French oak puncheons for 6 months, is the foundation for this gem. Add 1000 lbs. of fresh raspberries, allow a secondary wild fermentation for 4 more months and voila (!), we have a crisp effervescent concoction, bursting with raspberry perfume and flavor, a rosé color, bracing acidity, and a clean and refreshing finish."

It finishes with a lingering yet pleasant bitterness. Is it Overboard? You decide."

Humanity's path out of the Dark Age is one without end. This path carries us away from the mystical to the measurable, from the magical to the mathematical, and is a meticulous tale of progress from madness to method.

Out of this yearning for the old ways, Dark Age Imperial Stout emerges from the Whisky Barrel, its dark malt complexity and bold, yet balanced, sweetness softened by its mystical evolution in oak."

IJwit,Brouwerij 't IJ,3.87,"#15,984",37,107,9.82%,8,23,0,Netherlands,Belgian Witbier,6.50%,Year-round,"
A full-bodied, Amsterdam wheat beer that is dangerously ‘moreish’. Slightly cloudy, it has a beautiful golden colour and a soft, foamy head. When we brew IJwit, we use wheat malt as well as barley malt, which is also how the beer gets its name. The wheat malt gives the beer a delightful, fresh flavour, and the addition of coriander and lemon during the brewing process produces a rich aroma of banana, citrus and spices. Topped off by a fine, slightly sweet aftertaste, IJwit is a delicious thirst-quencher."

“It’s the most wonderful time of the year!” The hop harvest is a very special time for the craft brewing industry. For many of us, not only does it mean new opportunities with this next harvest’s finest hops, it also means wet hops, fresh off the bine. Early in the morning of Saturday, August 13th, several farmhands stayed up and harvested Chinook for us in Southern Colorado which would then be driven down for the sole purpose of making this very special batch of the IPA that put Albuquerque on the proverbial craft beer map. Rich with the fresh green aromas that only wet hops can bring, this is everything you love about Elevated IPA, and then some."

Duende is a hazy marigold in appearance with fluffy white foam. This beer is elegant for a Double IPA which leads to surprisingly easy drinkability. First impressions are a bright almost citrusy pine note that quickly switches gears to huge fruit notes: orange, grapefruit, apricot, and tangerine. There’s a consistent fruit flesh flavor to the beer that adds a wonderful complexity to the bright citrus notes as the overtones dance around the fleshy notes, supporting without ever getting in the way. As the flavor finishes there’s subtle earth and berry notes that come through and the beer finishes with a perfectly balanced bitterness that rounds out the alcohol sweetness and immediately invites you to take another sip."

SPENCER (The Dispenser of Provisions) is our annual fruit beer. In the early fall, we harvest wild blackcurrant fruit and add it to a batch of year-old SAHALIE. The sugars in the fruit produce another fermentation and the blackcurrant tannins create additional structure over the 8-month aging period. Prior to bottling, the beer is dry-hopped for a month in oak barrels. With close to 2 years in oak, Spencer has a much more developed Brettanomyces character than our other beers. Because of the extremely limited quantity of wild blackcurrant available, we produce only one oak barrel of Spencer every year."

Burial At Sea,DC Brau Brewing Co.,3.74,"#25,375",5,17,10.16%,1,0,0,District of Columbia,English Dark Mild Ale,4.50%,Rotating,"
Burial at Sea is a collaborative project between head brewer's Jeff Hancock of DC Brau and Stephen Jones of Oliver Ales in Baltimore, MD. Mild ales are traditionally referred to as ""session ales"" known for their low alcohol content which is around 3.2 - 4.0%. Despite their low alcohol content, Milds are just as flavorful as beers with a higher ABV. In crafting this beer we used only the finest malt's and hop's from England. Burial at Sea starts with a great malty nose boasting aromas of milk chocolate and biscuity sweetness. The beer has a medium mouthfeel that drinks with a soft, mineral smoothness and just enough hops to counter the chewy malt character. Fermented with a clean American yeast that lets the oats, barley and hops dominate and take center stage."

We constructed this beer around hops we currently have plenty of access to, allowing us to re-brew it on a (relatively) consistent basis. We smell a ton of orange on the nose, with complimentary notes of peach and passionfruit. The flavor is similar with a blast of citrus fruit & orange quickly followed by spicy grapefruit, and earthy dankness. A lingering but pleasant hop oil finish awaits."

Devil's Heart Of Gold,Perennial Artisan Ales,4.24,"#2,528",14,59,6.6%,24,13,4,Missouri,American Wheatwine Ale,10.00%,Rotating,"
The name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"" comes from what they call the ""Devil’s Cut"". When a bourbon ages in a barrel, a portion of the bourbon evaporates - this is called the ""Angel’s share"". Another portion of the bourbon gets absorbed into the new oak barrel - this is called the ""Devil’s cut"". Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"". We took our Heart of Gold and aged it in a Knob Creek 9-year old barrel from our friends at The Wine and Cheese Place in October 2011. The beer rested in these barrels for 7 months. 204 bottles will be released exclusively at The Wine and Cheese Place."

After the Equilibrista, our beer inspired by the Champagne world, here it is a new experiment on the “wine meets beer” theme. This time, though, we tipped the scales in favour of beer, adding to the Duchessa wort only a 25% of wine must: in this case we used Malvasia (coming from our friends of Tenuta di Bibbiano, as usual), a white, aromatic grape variety which gives the beer a gentle and nice sharpness and an inusual, fruity nose. The beer is bottle-fermentd using Champagne-yeasts, and it has a quite intense “perlage” (bubbles) that makes it perfect as an aperitif or even for the whole meal. The “chaotic” label was designed by Valentina De Luca, an Art student at the Istituto d’Istruzione Superiore Antonio Cederna of Velletri (Rome), who won our contest “Etichette Bizzarre”."

Sahati,The Ale Apothecary,4.29,"#1,351",15,144,8.16%,129,30,3,Oregon,Finnish Sahti,10.50%,Rotating,"
SAHATI is our interpretation of traditional Finnish sahti. Starting with a 200-year old Engelmann spruce tree felled on brewery property, we created our own kuurna (an ancient Scandinavian lauter tun) to separate the wort from the grain during brewing. The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year.  SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary, where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves."

Shikkoku is a Japanese word that evokes the jet-black color of onyx, perfect for this enchantingly dark, slow-aged brew marked by an elegant, mellow flavor profile. Enigmatic shadows contrast sharply with the brightness of its fine, tea-colored head, while the fragrance of aromatic hops delights the nose. Two types of black malt join six other malt varieties for a black lager that is smooth, light, and balanced—never cloying. Japan proudly offers this dark jewel to stand among the best dark beers in the world."

Sahalie is the flagship brand of The Ale Apothecary, brewed year-round of malted barley & wheat and Goschie Farms Cascade Hops. Hop bitterness and acid produced by our house lactobacillus culture provide the balance to the malt and oak structure of the beer. She spends up to 1 year in our oak barrels during a long, relaxed fermentation prior to a month-long dry-hopping (yes, in oak barrels!).  Our sensory experience is a tropical & citrus fruit nose of apricots, pineapple, and orange produced from yeast esters and hop oils. The palate is tart and pithy, combining earthy and herbal undertones that evolve as the beer warms & opens up within your glass."

""Brewed and packaged back in June 2011, Ganko Oyaji 2012 sports the same grist bill as previous versions, consisting of floor-malted Maris Otter and Bohemian Pils, as well as British crystal malt and 10% Japanese red (akato) sugar. Once again we increased our hop bittering slightly (up to 80 IBU from last year’s 75) and we changed our blend of hops, this year including Magnum, Galena, Nugget, Glacier and Santiam. Most importantly, though, we returned to full fermentation (primary and secondary) with our house Scottish ale yeast strain while also increasing the attenuative potential of our wort by both lowering mash temperature and lengthening mash duration. The result is a more highly attenuated, drier and stronger finished beer. Ganko Oyaji is an ideal after-dinner or before-bed restorative; it might even be delicious at breakfast too! It promises to condition nicely for months and years to come."""

First brewed by Harvest Moon in 1997, this beer is a multiple award-winning dark ale brewed in the Burton, England style owing to the similarity of water chemistry in Belt compared to this classic porter producing area in England. Plenty of body without a sharp bite, this ale is brewed with pale, caramel, chocolate and black malts to create a creamy, smooth, roasted, slightly chocolate tasting ale with a touch of hops in the finish. This ale can be enjoyed in every season and is best when served cool, not cold. And why the name? While drinking this new brew one evening back in 1997, the local hog farmer showed up to collect our spent mash and we that what could be better for fattening pigs?"

Rugged and resilient, rye has been a staple grain for ages and its spicy black pepper-like flavor has been prized by distillers and brewers for centuries. Rye thrives in the harshest conditions and comes to life in Ruthless, a rugged IPA with fruity, citrus and herbal hop notes countered by the dry spiciness of the rye. Holding a steadfast balance between contrasting malt and hop character, Ruthless is bold enough to inspire even the most brazen hop head to bear down and embrace the flavor."

Head High,Kane Brewing Company,4.26,"#1,356",146,892,8.45%,127,228,4,New Jersey,American IPA,6.50%,Year-round,"
Head High is our interpretation of an American-style India Pale Ale (IPA). This beer is all about the hops; we use a blend of five different varieties all grown in the Pacific Northwest. A small charge of Chinook and Columbus early in the boil adds a smooth bitterness. A majority of the hops are then added late in the kettle or post-fermentation to produce a beer that is heavy on hop flavor and aroma. The combination of Cascade, Centennial, Citra and Columbus give Head High a noticeable grapefruit flavor with aromas of citrus, tropical fruits and pine. Our house American ale yeast ferments to a dry finish that accentuates the use of imported Pilsner and lightly kilned crystal malt resulting in Head High’s straw color and crisp flavor."

Hardywood Gingerbread Stout, described by BeerAdvocate as “freagin’ Christmas in a bottle,” is an imperial milk stout brewed with vanilla beans, cinnamon, fresh Casselmonte Farm baby ginger and Bearer Farms wildflower honey. Gingerbread Stout is then matured in Virginia bourbon barrels, where it adapts an incredibly mellow character with oak, caramel and bourbon undertones, and emerges 12 weeks later as Bourbon GBS. A festive blend of spice character laces this rich, chocolatey stout, which warms the palate and the soul."
Moveable Type,Foundation Brewing Company,4.18,"#4,666",7,32,5.74%,3,3,0,Maine,Belgian Saison,7.90%,Rotating,"
Moveable Type is a farmhouse ale created in the tradition of an old world saison. We began by brewing a provision strength ale, which we then cellared for over a year with Brettanomyces. During the months of cellaring, our saison yeast and the Brettanomyces worked together to create a beer rich in tropical fruit notes, balanced by an underlying earthiness. Bottle conditioned, the beer will continue to evolve. This movement in flavor is something we love about farmhouse ales, like a printer’s type, periodically reset to tell a new story."

Oude Tart is a Flemish-Style Red Ale aged in red wine barrels for up to 18 months. This version has had cherries added for the final stages of barrel aging. It's pleasantly sour with hints of leather, tangy dark fruit, plump cherries and toasty oak. While the base beer is one of the more classic styles that we make, it's not a style that you can find too often in the United States. Originating in style from the Flanders region of Belgium, near the French border, this dark, sour ale has roots deep in brewing history and predates most of the ales that have become popular in contemporary culture. We're doing our best to keep the tradition alive by brewing and aging this beer here on the West Coast."

We find it to be tremendously drinkable in spite of its stature, and we believe it is the perfect beer for those in search of intense flavor and supreme refreshment.

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 75 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased."
Solstice D'été Aux Framboises,Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!,4.26,"#1,438",92,392,7.75%,185,50,3,Quebec,Berliner Weisse,5.90%,Summer,"
German inspired sour wheat beer. The obvious and domineering acidity of this beer is obtained by letting the unboiled wort go sour for several days. The Solstice d’Été is made complete by the addition, during the fermentation process, of a phenomenal quantity of whole fruit (raspberries or mangos or cherries) which compensate for the sourness of the beer. The result is a very refreshing beer where both acidity and fruity flavours dominate wholeheartedly."

Yeah You Know Me is a massive 15% Imperial Stout brewed in collaboration with Kyle from Horus Aged Ales. Our goal was to make a thick, fudgey imperial stout. We started with a double mashed imperial stout base. Post fermentation we added the most insane coffee we could find. This single origin coffee from the Fazenda Santa Ines farm in Brazil had cocoa nibs and almonds added to it while roasting. As a result, the coffee imparted deep cocoa and nutty aromas into this beer."

Juice Machine was originally devised and brewed to support our very first trip to Extreme Beer Festival in 2014. We’ve revived and tweaked the original recipe on a 30 BBL scale and brought new life and experience into the idea of an obscenely hop saturated yet juicy and delicate Double IPA. It is essentially a marriage of the King Julius malt bill with a hopping intensity schedule similar to that of Very Green. The use of Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy creates perhaps our most complex drink with unapologetic flavors of tangerine, mango, lime, papaya, and grapefruit with waves of dankness. Hop burp nirvana, indeed."

Single Shot is a decadent yet balanced milk stout that we use as a base to impart bold and varied coffee flavors from hand selected beans on a varying basis. This particular batch was brewed with coffee beans from Brazil. It exhibits notes of dark chocolate, dark fruit, and toasted marshmallows - a unique and intriguing showcase of beans, for sure. Single Shot is exceptionally creamy on the palate while maintaining a lightness that leaves you wanting more… a true treat in the can paired with the embrace of a summer campfire. When kept cold at all times in the can it should be great until Autumn."

In looking at the 2016 version then, Grandma’s Boy still includes the deep golden colour, brett aromatics, yellow shiro plums, and the dry body. Our desire was to to lighten up the ABV, increase the acidity, and turn it into the A+++ we knew it could be (no further comments necessary). The new designation of “Wild Ale” more accurately reflects the style, allowing for acidity and the contribution of multiple strains of brett. Grandma’s Boy 2016 is all about clean brett aromatics, juicy stone fruit flavours, and a subtle but decidedly spicy oak character. The body is dry and lightly acidic, with notes of underripe pear, apricot, and plum."

A religious zealot with a long family history of insanity, one of Brown's favorite maxims was ""Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins"". During his colorful career with the free state militia, Brown made sure that there was no shortage of the remissions of sins."

Our signature American pale ale balances light, crisp, malt character with an abundance of hop-derived aromatics and flavors from the use of Citra and Columbus. The fragrant nose is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, and peach. Bold flavors of pineapple and mango mix with dank notes of zesty citrus and fresh pine needles.

Brewer's Notes: Baird Morning Coffee Stout 2006 is formulated to specs similar to a Foreign Export Stout but with one major twist  the addition of fresh coffee beans to the ingredient list. This year, we ground at the brewery and steeped in the whirlpool a Mocha Blend Coffee with beans coming from Brazil, Ethiopia and Indonesia. The rich sweetness of the mocha coffee is aided beautifully by a blend of highly roasted Chocolate and Black malts, while the stimulating acridity of the java beans is underscored by an ensemble of Nugget, Horizon and Mount Hood hops. Somehow, this mysterious brew is at once both enervating and energizing!"

Single Shot W/ Vanilla Bean,Tree House Brewing Company,4.46,#280,46,218,6.05%,43,49,0,Massachusetts,English Sweet / Milk Stout,6.40%,Rotating,"
We are excited to present the first variant of our coffee milk stout: SINGLE SHOT w/ Vanilla Bean! This modification builds upon the original by conditioning the finished beer on Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans. We also varied the typical coffee blend by infusing a single beautiful coffee, Guatemala Candelaria! What resulted is a beer that exhibits a subtle and well integrated vanilla note with rich coffee character while retaining a wonderful airiness and drinkability. The crew here tastes bourbon chocolate, brown sugar, and vanilla with a soft coffee acidity on the finish. The vanilla reveals nuanced character as it warms, though never overwhelming the senses, with the coffee notes slowly mellowing. This is a real treat to us, and one that marks the start of an invigorating path for Single Shot!"

Central Wisconsin is cranberry country, so it was easy to fall in love with the idea of aging our insanely tart sour ale on this beloved super fruit.

Imperial Java Stout,Santa Fe Brewing Company,4.04,"#6,117",243,"1,040",10.15%,96,199,6,New Mexico,American Imperial Stout,8.00%,Winter,"
This is the kind of beer that gives the word ""stout"" a reputation. Extra generous quantities of barley malt, followed by vigorous fermentation leaves this ""imperial"" heavy weight with 8% alcohol A.B.V. and a body as full as chocolate bread pudding. A complimentary and complex array of bitter notes comes form potent American hops, earthy British hops, black-roasted malts and, of course, coffee. Santa Fe Brewing Company uses only top-quality ingredients like organically grown East Timor coffee beans blended with New Guinea coffee beans, locally roasted by O'hori's Coffee House. Its heavenly flavor and aroma can't be beat or imitated."

Edward (1917-2002) is our grandfather; Hill Farmstead Brewery rests upon the land that was once home to him and his five children. In his honor, this American Pale Ale is dutifully crafted from American malted barley, a plethora of American hops, our ale yeast and water from Edward’s well. It is unfiltered, naturally carbonated, and dry hopped. Aromatic and flowery, with impressions of citrus and pine, this is the ale that I dream to have shared with Edward. "

At Arrogant Bastard Brewing Co., we believe that pandering to the lowest common denominator represents the height of tyranny—a virtual form of keeping the consumer barefoot and stupid. Brought forth upon an unsuspecting public in 1997, Arrogant Bastard Ale openly challenged the tyrannical overlords who were brazenly attempting to keep Americans chained in the shackles of poor taste. As the progenitor of its style, Arrogant Bastard Ale has reveled in its unprecedented and uncompromising celebration of intensity. There have been many nods to Arrogant Bastard Ale...even outright attempts to copy it...but only one can ever embody the true nature of Liquid Arrogance!"

The First release in Old Nation's ""New Orthodox"" IPA series, M-43 is designed to accentuate the deep and complex character from the combination of Calypso, Simcoe, Citra and Amarillo hops. Citrus and Tropical notes of Pineapple, Mango and Grapefruit come through in the huge, yet surprisingly delicate aroma. The flavor backs these aromas with a soft, pillowy mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is not particularly intense, which leads to a very drinkable, New England IPA even non-IPA fans love. The Haze is not from yeast, but rather from an interplay of lipids from the malted oat and oils and acids which naturally occur in the hand selected Dry hops. This beer is a perfect interplay between top grade malt and hops, MI water and brewing technique which cannot be faked."

A Welsh Style Tribute Stout. Pronounced “Gwin Dee,” this robust dark beer is named for Paul Marshall’s distant in-laws who owned the famed Welsh winery said to be the real birthplace of Guinness stout. A historic blend of roasted barley, black and chocolate malts produce a smooth stout with notable dark chocolate and coffee aromas. This Welsh tribute stouts dry finish counterbalances the boldness of its roasted grains."
The Goat,Holy Mountain Brewing Company,4.13,"#4,273",18,86,6.78%,10,15,1,Washington,Belgian Saison,4.90%,Rotating,"
The Goat is our rustic brett saison, brewed with barley, rye, oats, and wheat, and heavily hopped with European hops. This batch was fermented in our foudre with two saison strains and brett, then allowed to age for three months. The Goat was refermented in the bottle with brett, and has been conditioning for four months. Although we plan to brew The Goat again, there will never be a batch like this, and we don’t have immediate plans to ferment another batch in the foudre or to age it for so long before release. This batch has white wine notes from the brett, opening up with pear, mint, and oak. Bone dry and 4.9% ABV, this beer is wonderfully effervescent, perfect for summer drinking. Many thanks to our friend Brian Steely for the illustration and to our friend Jordan Butcher for additional label design."

Sweet, roasty and always invigorating, traditional Latin American cafe con leche coffee can be found nearly everywhere in our hometown of Tampa, Florida and serves as the inspiration for our Cafe Con Leche Sweet Stout. The beer is made with bold, strong coffee beans to emulate the most characterful Cuban espresso and lactose, a milk sugar that adds sweetness, body and flavors reminiscent of scalded milk. We’ve also added cacao nibs to further enhance the satisfying chocolate quality of the beer. Despite it’s assertive flavors and full body, our sweet stout is deceptively low in alcohol, making it the perfect accompaniment to a late-morning plate of eggs, bacon and tostadas."

Like India Pale Ale, the classic Imperial Stouts were originally brewed with high levels of alcohol and hops to withstand the rigors of a long sea journey, not to India but to Imperial Russia and the Baltic States. Our version is an over-the-top riff on the style, with a huge grain bill featuring several kinds of malted barley, wheat, rye, oats, and spelt. Robust grain and coffee flavors are counterbalanced by date and plum notes from the Belgian yeast. To add extra complexity and depth, this Imperial Stout is made up of a blend of freshly brewed beer and several barrel-aged beers, carefully balanced. Za Vas!"

Hell On Wood is medium/full-bodied and amber in color with a thin, persistent, off-white head. Its mesmerizing citrus flavors and aromas, accented by notes of charred oak, vanilla, and caramelized sugar, give way to a palate dominating hop finish balanced by smoky, bourbon character and a warming alcohol presence (10.6% alcohol by volume). There’s no escape; prepare to fall to the seductive power of Hell On Wood!"

It’s a brett beer, not a sour, and the fruit is a subtle counterpart to the dry saison."

Based on our award-winning recipe that debuted at Cask Days 2012, this smooth elixir is your partner in crime. In second-use cognac barrels (previously housing Bring Out Your Dead), this rich and complex imperial stout gains a complexity that can only come with age, aided by the addition of cherries, raspberries, and cocoa nibs. Deep roasted flavours hint at all the black coffee and dark chocolate you could ever want, and the cherries create a complimentary tartness that marries the fruit and malt perfectly."

One of the most sought-after stouts in Bell's history, Black Note Stout blends the complex aromatics of Expedition Stout with the velvety smooth texture of Double Cream Stout and ages the combination in freshly retired oak bourbon barrels for months.

For Teton Range IPA, Idaho grown and malted barley make up 90% of the grain bill. We use a variety of Idaho hops including one of our new favorites, Idaho 7. The combination of these unique hops makes Teton Range IPA an amazingly aromatic and flavorful beer. We focus on late hop additions in the kettle to boost the aroma and keep the bitterness low. Pungent aromas of tropical fruits like mango and papaya, hints of pine, hard candy and citrus rind are prominent. The flavor is juicy, like fresh squeezed tropical fruit with some pine in the background. The beer has a deep gold color and strong head retention. The crisp, balanced flavors of Teton Range IPA create a delicious, drinkable beer."

This year (2006) marks the sixth annual release of The Carpenters Mikan Ale. As the name suggests, it is an ale made with fresh mikans (a tangerine-like Japanese fruit). We receive the mikans as a gift from the Heda orchard of our carpenter friend, partner and mentor  Mitsuo Nagakura. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he is the complete embodiment of the dedicated, uncompromising and passionate Japanese craftsmen whom we so respect and whom we strive to emulate. The Carpenters Mikan Ale is our modest attempt to pay tribute to Nagakura-san as well as to all great Japanese craftsmen. "

This is an unapologetic beer. Dark, viscous, bitter, and rich — it's a dangerous elixir of love. Originally developed by English brewers in the 18th century for export to the court of Catherine the Great in Russia, our interpretation of the style would surely make lady C proud. We’ve waited our whole lives to brew a beer with such bravado, and it always sells out faster than we can supply the next batch. Some people claim that imperial stouts are only for the dead of winter, but we feel that this sidekick is there for you, anytime you call."

With an ABV of 9.8%* and bold aromas and flavors of coffee and chocolate - this beer is the perfect beginning of an exciting fall and winter of rich seasonal offerings."
Leaning Barn,Payette Brewing,3.74,"#25,196",3,10,10.96%,0,0,0,Idaho,Belgian Saison,4.50%,Summer,"
The Leaning Barn is named after the Old Tate Barn on Idaho 55 on the way from Boise to McCall, the one that after every winter seems a little bit closer to falling over, but still hasn’t. The Leaning Barn is our take on a Belgian Saison, a style that was traditionally brewed in the spring to last through the hot summer months. The beer is light and refreshing, but packs a flavorful punch. The Leaning Barn has strong citrusy aromas of lemon and orange with some sublte spicy notes in the background. It finishes dry with a slightly tart bite to finish it off. It will be your best companion on a patio as the Idaho heat starts to rise this summer."

Building off our learnings from developing, brewing and conditioning both newer double and triple IPAs as well as milestone hop giants like Headroom, this triple IPA centers on some of our favorite varietals to sets the new high water mark for the largest hop charge, to date.

The art and science of brewing continues to captivate us - every opportunity to experiment in search of how to improve our beer, and to further our understanding of what ultimately makes a beer enjoyable, enriches our spirit! To that end, Curiosity Forty Four combines several of our very favorite American and Australian hops, including Galaxy, Citra, Simcoe, and Amarillo in the kettle and heavy doses of Citra and Galaxy in the dry hop. The result is a heavily tropical Double IPA dripping with fruity hop oil saturation. Utilizing a new technique, the majority of the carbonation in Forty Four developed naturally in the fermenter during conditioning. The result is a uniquely soft body and tight carbonation lending supreme drinkability and flavor that ignites the senses and invites the next sip. We hope it can contribute in a meaningful way to a special moment in your life."

Pursuit of Hoppiness Imperial Red Ale is brewed to showcase the brash beauty of American hops: Chinook, Centennial and Columbus at 100 International Bitterness Units (IBU). The hops grown in the United States are considered to be some of the best in the world. Compared to their more traditionally subdued, elegant European counterparts, American hops are bold, bright, piney and zesty. This ale is brewed with Idaho 2-Row malted barley and German specialty malts to provide a rich, slightly caramel flavor and bold reddish color. At 22 degrees Plato starting gravity and about 8.5% alcohol by volume, this thick and warming beer is to be shared and savored."

Clean this mess up or else we'll all end up in jail...those test tubes and the scale...just get 'em all outta here..."" He was referring to the complex super-critical-CO2 hop extraction equipment set up on the table in the lab across from the brewhouse. Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers, he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers, not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse. The sensuous honey-like amber ooze was administered intravenously to the wort kettle and the sacrament was complete. Another kettle of Hop Stoopid is once again raised up and fermented on high."

As the oldest brewery in the world, we are now aiming to focus more attention on our old recipes and rediscover these often exceptional beer types anew – just as we did with our 1516 Kellerbier. The sight of a historical label from the 1950s reminded us of a beer that has almost slipped into oblivion: Kristallweizenbock, still brewed at Weihenstephan all those decades ago, but sought in vain on today’s beer market. Our Weihenstephan master brewers set to work developing a new version of Kristallweizenbock, choosing premium hop varieties Saphir, Opal, Smaragd and Perle (Sapphire, Opal, Emerald and Pearl) to create its character. This combination resulted in the distinctive hoppy bouquet of our Kristallweizenbock, complemented by the subtle banana aroma of the yeast. Careful filtration preserves the beer’s crystal-clear amber glow."

Grand Teton’s Double IPA was born in our renowned Cellar Reserve program. Fans of our Double IPA and XX Sweetgrass demanded we brew the style on a regular basis. In response, we created Lost Continent in 2009 and updated it for 2010. This year's version is brewed with well over three pounds of hops per barrel in the kettle and another half-pound per barrel of “dry hops” in two additions during conditioning. A revised fermentation program has produced a more traditional Double IPA flavor profile--drier, less malty, more hoppy."

To call Nelson Sauvin an aggressive hop would be a vast understatement. What would happen if you made a DIPA that featured this hop??? Over 10 lbs./bbl of hops went into this gem of a DIPA. A ridiculous level of hop aroma, followed by a hop flavor that is literally juicy in texture. The bitterness is undefinable, just unreal. If our Elevated IPA is on the hoppy side of the aisle for you, stay away. If you drink that beer and think to yourself in Homer Simpson’s voice, “That’s kinda hoppy… I guess…” prepare to meet your match. This beer is gonna put the beat down.

While playing our usual hoppy games recently we were similarly inspired by the lemony bitterness of the new ""Lemon Drop"" hop from our friends at Hopsteiner. With ""SS 2014 Yirgacheffe"" we bridge our “Need A Bigger Boat” recipe from 2012 to these flavors with the helping hand of the lemon notes of Sorachi Ace hops.

We’re excited to introduce Cerveza Sin Frontera, a three part collaboration between Jester King, Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project in Denver, Colorado and Brasserie Trois Dames in Sainte Croix, Switzerland. The concept behind Cerveza Sin Frontera was to brew an identical recipe, referment it in the same type of barrels (Spanish sherry) at three different locations on earth, and allow the microorganisms unique to each brewery to impart interesting and differentiating characteristics to the beer. In other words, Cerveza Sin Frontera seeks to explore the impact that mixed culture fermentation has upon an identical recipe for wort (unfermented beer). It highlights how fermentation that exists outside the world of pure culture brewers yeast has the ability to create unique beer with a sense of place."

Starting with six different hop varietals added to the brew kettle & culminating with a massive dry-hop addition of Simcoe hops, Bell's Hopslam Ale possesses the most complex hopping schedule in the Bell's repertoire. Selected specifically because of their aromatic qualities, these Pacific Northwest varieties contribute a pungent blend of grapefruit, stone fruit, and floral notes. A generous malt bill and a solid dollop of honey provide just enough body to keep the balance in check, resulting in a remarkably drinkable rendition of the Double India Pale Ale style."

The Beer Formerly Known as LA TACHE is the table sour produced year-round by The Ale Apothecary. (TBFKA) LA TACHE is made of malted barley & wheat and Goschie Farms Cascade Hops. The hops are used only for aroma as the balance of the beer comes from acid produced by our house lactobacillus culture. She spends up to one year in our barrels during a long, relaxed fermentation prior to a month-long dry-hopping (yes, in oak barrels!). Our sensory experience is lemon citrus & fermented orchard fruit nose over earthy undertones. The palate finishes with soft lactic acid balanced by the malt body."

Originally an Against the Grain Brewery and Brouwerij De Molen collaboration beer. For the first incarnation, De Molen head brewer Menno Oliver hopped in a muscle car and drove straight through from the Netherlands to Louisville, KY (that's USA folks) to brew this bourbon inspired ale, and we liked it so much, we decided to do it again. We took the ingredients in bourbon whiskey (Barley, Rye, Corn) and then smoked them with cherry wood and brewed a huge imperial stout with them. Then to top it off we aged it in Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon Barrels. The resulting beer is rich, smokey and complex, with a bourbon character of caramel, vanilla and spice."

This doppel is started with a base of Pilsen malt. It is colored and flavored by caravienne, caramunich and special-B malts. A large portion of Munich malt is used for its distinctly German flavor and aroma, as well as a little aromatic malt. Finally, there is some carapils to add to the full body. It is also flavored with moderate amounts of Yakima Perle and German Hallertau hops to balance the malty sweetness. Though the IBU level is pretty high, this is not a hoppy beer. It's just that it takes a lot of hops to balance out such a malty beer. (O.G. 20.5P/1082. Hops - 46 IBUs)"

Flambeau Red,New Orleans Lager & Ale Brewing Company (NOLA),3.93,"#13,211",12,46,9.16%,8,3,0,Louisiana,American Amber / Red Ale,5.70%,Winter,"
The creation of Flambeau Red starts with the selection of seven unique malts, to give a complex profile which is the foundation of this seasonal ale. Complemented by the barrage of three hop varieties, this is one incredibly well balanced American style red ale. The extreme depth of flavors are our focus, while the American ale yeast used for fermentation allows them to pop on the canvas that is Flambeau Red. The result of NOLA’s latest seasonal brew is one incendiary beer, as bright and warm as the keepers of the flame that light the parade route during Mardi Gras nights."

Some would argue that Speedway Stout, easily one of the finest coffee-infused imperial stouts in the world, needs no embellishment, that this burly yet beguilingly smooth and easy-drinking beer is perfect on its own. We’re not ones to disagree, but a thirst for experimentation leads us to tinker with our recipes—even those of the highest order. In the case of Hammerhead Speedway Stout, we endeavored to maximize java intensity as baristas do with the classic coffee-house offering, the “hammerhead,” in which a shot of espresso is added to a cup of coffee. For this beer, we take our already coffee-rich Speedway Stout and add a plentiful dose of crushed Ethiopian and espresso beans. The result is a sultry, velveteen beer with eye-opening bite."

Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),Boulevard Brewing Co.,4.25,"#1,428",743,"2,624",10.35%,570,"1,025",73,Missouri,Belgian Quadrupel (Quad),11.80%,Rotating,"
Based loosely on the Smokestack Series’ The Sixth Glass, this abbey-style quadrupel is separated into a number of oak bourbon barrels where it ages for varying lengths of time, some for up to three years. Cherries are added to make up for the “angel's share” of beer lost during barrel aging. Selected barrels are then blended for optimum flavor. The resulting beer retains only very subtle cherry characteristics, with toffee and vanilla notes coming to the fore."

PRIDE Belgian-style Strong Pale Ale boasts a glorious deep gold color and an amazing yet arrogant head. Plentiful pale malt creates beautiful, agile body. Assertive hops and Belgian yeast achieve charismatic floral and spice notes in aroma and flavor.

At once tart and refreshing yet earthy and musty, Pride is unlike most beers on earth. And it’s bitter, lingering finish demands another sip."

Foudreweizen took the DNA, so to speak, of one of our absolute favorite beers in the world — Live Oak Hefeweizen — and allowed it to fundamentally transform through mixed culture fermentation with brewers yeast and native microorganisms from the Texas Hill Country. The transformation was indeed dramatic! For the first few weeks, the beer was very reminiscent of Live Oak Hefeweizen, and had a lovely clove character. But as time progressed, and native yeast and bacteria became more dominant, the beer became funky and developed barnyard aromas. After two months in the foudre, a tartness began to emerge as lactic acid producing bacteria began to convert organic compounds into organic acids. Finally, Foudreweizen continued to develop more funk and acidity as it matured in bottles, kegs, and casks during the two months prior to release."

Same base grist as Sleeper Street IPA, but with a double dose of El Dorado in the dry hop. These El Dorado hops impart a powerful aroma of distinctive lime zest, along with notes of grapefruit juice, and a subtle woodsy earthiness.

As with all Trillium “Street” IPA’s, Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street is dry with medium-light body and a crisp finish."

Brewing is the craft of blending science with artistry then introducing the mystical. Field to Ferment exempliﬁes this adventure. We will brew this fresh hop ale throughout the entire hop harvest in Yakima using each of four hop varieties as they are harvested. At least that’s the plan. Nature may have a different plan. Such is the harvest. Each can has a date and brew number stamped on the bottom; check FremontBrewing.com for the exact hops used in your beer. In order of harvest, we will brew with fresh Centennial, Simcoe,™ Citra,™ and ﬁnally Mosaic™ hops. Field to Ferment represents a colossal collaboration between the brewery and our hop farmers. No one has attempted to brew fresh hop beers throughout the entire season. We will make countless trips between the ﬁelds in Yakima and the brewery in Fremont, loaded with tens of thousands of pounds of fresh, juicy hops. Nothing is fresher, nothing is better for a brewer. So, please do enjoy this beer absolutely fresh, and enjoy the adventure this beer represents…Because Fresh Hop Beer Matters! “Fresh hops are the best hops.” – VWP"

The flavor follows suit with a pulpy grapefruit note as the predominant characteristic. Super Sap finishes gently with a soft pine-like bitterness buoyed by a fluffy mouthfeel.

Our friend Pat Mcilhenney, owner and brewer at Alpine Beer Co., and his wife Val visited us in August of 2015 while on an East Coast vacation, so why not brew a beautiful, hoppy collaboration? This IPA is truly a collaboration of styles, techniques and philosophies—resulting in a harmonious, cross-country, hop-forward beer that could only be the product of true mutual admiration. "

Cutting Tiles is an exploratory series of Double IPA's featuring a range of aromatic single hop varietals brewed with raw wildflower honey. This new version is dosed with 100% Citra in all kettle, whirlpool and two massive dry hop additions. The local wildflower honey keeps the body light and drinkable but provides a earthy backbone. Floral and zesty up front backed up with a nuanced citrus character on the nose that continues straight through in the flavor profile. Pillowy soft mouthfeel, with a restrained bitterness on the finish. New variants to follow!"

This one’s for the beer geek in all of us. The Gold Stock is a cult classic that’s offered up only one or two times a year. If you catch the rare sighting of this “draft only” beer, rejoice. What we did first when we made this was we brewed a full-bodied, golden ale. Then we went absolutely nuts with the pricey German hops. This smooth but biting beer is our own individual take on the pleasant India Pale Ale. It’s one of those beers you have to try. Look for it and order two!"
Happy Camper IPA,Santa Fe Brewing Company,3.76,"#24,091",169,650,12.23%,33,154,1,New Mexico,American IPA,6.60%,Year-round,"
A classic beer for those beer lovers who love their hops, Happy Camper IPA will take the Pepsi Challenge (or IPA challenge, as we say in New Mexico) against any other pretenders to the throne. Was it divine providence that made this beer the king of the IPA world? Was it a tireless pursuit of glory? No, this IPA has a top-secret recipe to thank for its success, and this meticulously formulated combination of several different hops combined with a very specific brewing process give Happy Camper IPA a spicy, citric, and floral infusion of hop character, which is masterfully counterbalanced with the full-bodied maltiness characteristic of the Santa Fe Brewing Company’s distinctive beers."

Brewed since 1989, Keystone Light is a triple-filtered American-style light lager. Or as we like to say, it’s the smoothest of smooth.

Untamed, unpredictable and full of unforgettable character; that's a Rustler for you.

Shortly after we started distributing, we had our cursed old brewery truck break down while carrying a load of kegs to our distributor. Our distributor was about to close for the weekend, and we had no way to get them there in time, and nowhere to store them in good condition during the opressively hot weather. As is our habit during times of stress, we sought a cold beer at the newly opened taproom and growler station around the corner, Tin Bucket. After chatting with the owner, he expressed his disappointment at not being able to get our beer. To cut it short, he and his partner bought the entire truckload, saving not just the beer, but quite literally our business."

The name ‘Barista’ conjures thoughts of the fragrance of steaming coffee below a layer of expertly created froth. This may sounds rather far-fetched for a beer... However, the aromas and the flavours of caramel, cacao and roast malt match seamlessly with the ‘black gold’ and chocolate. This beer builds bridges with the world of hot beverages, with warming alcohol in the finish. One to enjoy all the year round: with a meal, in front of an open fire or on an outdoor terrace."

Double Dry Hopped Galaxy Juicy Bits,WeldWerks Brewing Co.,4.34,"#1,445",4,53,5.3%,5,2,0,Colorado,American IPA,6.70%,Rotating,"
We got our hands on even more Galaxy hops to use with Juicy Bits, our popular New England-IPA featuring a huge citrus and tropical fruit hop character with a softer, smoother mouthfeel from the adjusted water chemistry, higher protein malts, and lower attenuation. For this Galaxy DDH batch of Juicy Bits, we dry hopped with nearly 4 lbs per bbl of Galaxy hops, in addition to the normal dry hop schedule of Citra, Mosiac, and El Dorado, bringing the total hop rate to over 7 lbs per bbl! We also extended the dry hop a touch longer and attenuated the beer a bit further, resulting in an incredibly bright hop character, a soft, pillowy mouthfeel, with very little malt sweetness so that the focus is on squarely on the incredible hop character."

A Duvel is still seen as the reference among strong golden ales. Its bouquet is lively and tickles the nose with an element of citrus which even tends towards grapefruit thanks to the use of only the highest-quality hop varieties. This is also reflected in the flavour, which is beautifully balanced with a hint of spiciness. Thanks to its high CO2 content, this beer has a wonderful roundness in the mouth. A Duvel is both the perfect thirst quencher and the ideal aperitif."

Our Tripel is a pale colored ale made with Pilsen malt and a traditional addition of Belgian candy sugar, then hopped with German Noble and Saaz hops. This ale has a light malt nose and a ubtle hop aroma."

What's the first thing you need to do when you start a brewery? Develop your logo, of course. With any potentially decent brewery, your logo must be a skull, it has to be a skull, you'll be laughed out of the room if you don't have a skull. So we went hunting in the area where all the great skulls have come from and were shit out of luck. By those fateful dumpsters all we found was this deformed neanderthal type deal, or maybe it's from an ape, and a big ol' pile of face. To celebrate our lack of success in finding a really cool skull, we are embracing another required cliché by brewing this American IPA. A modicum of simple malts provide the mediocre backbone to the mountain of various hops that are utilized and rotated throughout the brewing process. Look for dank overtones supported by various citrus and heirloom fruits. It's the straight forward fuckin' IPA that you always wanted from us. You lucky bastard."

Brewing is the craft of blending science with artistry then introducing the mystical. Field to Ferment exempliﬁes this adventure. We will brew this fresh hop ale throughout the entire hop harvest in Yakima using each of four hop varieties as they are harvested. At least that’s the plan. Nature may have a different plan. Such is the harvest. Each can has a date and brew number stamped on the bottom; check FremontBrewing.com for the exact hops used in your beer. In order of harvest, we will brew with fresh Centennial, Simcoe,™ Citra,™ and ﬁnally Mosaic™ hops. Field to Ferment represents a colossal collaboration between the brewery and our hop farmers. No one has attempted to brew fresh hop beers throughout the entire season. We will make countless trips between the ﬁelds in Yakima and the brewery in Fremont, loaded with tens of thousands of pounds of fresh, juicy hops. Nothing is fresher, nothing is better for a brewer. So, please do enjoy this beer absolutely fresh, and enjoy the adventure this beer represents…Because Fresh Hop Beer Matters! “Fresh hops are the best hops.” – VWP"

This beer is very unique and inspired by breweries in the Lambic region of Belgium and, especially, our friends at Cantillon. It is 100% spontaneously fermented, meaning yeast is not added. Once the beer is brewed, it is transferred to a cool-ship or “horny” tank located in our barrel room at the pub. There it sits overnight and collects whatever funky wild yeast and bacteria may be living in the room. The next day it is transferred to oak wine barrels where it ferments wildly and ages for a few months. The end result is a wild, spontaneously fermented, sour, and tasty hand-crafted beer!"

Most breweries have at least one piece of equipment that’s just a bit persnickity. Here at Boulevard we have fermenter number seven, the black sheep of our cellar family. Ironically, when our brewers were experimenting with variations on a traditional Belgian-style farmhouse ale, the perfect combination of elements came together in that very vessel. You could call it fate, but they called it Tank 7, and so it is. Beginning with a big surge of fruity aromatics and grapefruit-hoppy notes, the flavor of this complex, straw-colored ale tapers off to a peppery, dry finish."

We are so pleased to welcome Double Shot back to the line-up! For this batch, we utilized an inspirational coffee roasted by our friends at Olympia Coffee Company in Olympia Washington. As fate would have it, our search for the very best hops brought us into the realm of this exemplary roaster. The base beer for this batch is as rich as it has ever been; a function of carefully selected ingredients and uncompromising, hands on brewing processes. Guatemala El Socorro Mara is a characterful bean, and here it presents with flavors of cherry chocolate, cacao nib, dark spiced rum, honey, and even hints of tropical fruit. Flavors from the base beer - milk chocolate and chocolate mousse - peak through to provide layer upon layer of exceptional depth and complexity. This is a real treat, and one that will reward the senses as the beer is allowed to warm in the glass. We believe it is best enjoyed with a friend as a digestif to a fulfilling harvest dinner. Enjoy."

At 5.6% strength, its gets compelling character not from leftover yeast—in fact the beer is centrifuged to a precise degree, leaving only faint haze in its orange-amber color—but from an unusual combination of hops. Joining lemony-herbal Hallertauer Mittelfrüh is a rare heirloom hop called Hallertauer Record. Schäfer said that the variety has nearly disappeared—only one hectare grew last year—but he wanted its spicy character. It’s not a flashy beer meant for sipping and sampling; just a tasty one that will reward repeat drinking."

James and Julie is our take on a Flemish sour brown and offers an aroma of raisins, figs, cherries, and caramelized sugar. Mahogany in color, this medium-bodied ale finishes with clean acidity and a hint of spice. We brew this sour brown ale with Pilsner, Special B, Maize, and Chocolate Malt and ferment it with our house yeast strain. It then ages for two years on stainless steel with our own blend of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus cultures."

This beer was conceived with the intent to push the concept of Doppelganger to the limit of flavor and intensity. Both the kettle hopping rates and dry hopping rates were increased while keeping the base beer the same. The result is intense, but also surprising in its balance and softness. The mouthfeel is viscous and coating with flavors of overripe mango, dank citrus, and tropical fruit balanced by a sharp but pleasant finish.

BBBrighttt w/ Galaxy is a clean and elegant showcase for our favorite southern hemisphere hop - GALAXY! It builds upon the base beer resulting in an amplified flavor profile as a function of additional kettle and dry hopping from the base recipe. It tastes intense and much like fresh squeezed pineapple juice. A light body and fluffy mouthfeel make this beer such a pleasure to drink. We love the Bright series for its individualism as it allows the pure character of the hop to shine, foregoing the hop compound biotransformation that contributes depth, complexity, and originality to our core Tree House IPA's. With this beer you get perhaps the most authentic and intense Galaxy hop candy in our line-up, and what a sweet treat it is!"

Why Rye? This assertively flavorful grain is more often associated with whiskey than with ales. Even in that arena, it has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks? Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish."

A heavy dose of rye breathes new life into this other-worldly strong ale. Supple spice and barley sweetness strike a balance in the young beer before its enlightenment in Heaven Hill Rye Whiskey barrels. Ethereal waves of dark fruit and vanilla ascend from the depths as the elixir warms while the rye character lends a stunningly silky mouthfeel. Perhaps it's a doorway to an existential awakening, or maybe it's just a damned fine beer."

The resulting rich, golden ale features smooth notes of coconut, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon."

Do not waste time attempting to box this brew into some esoteric guide to styles. This is Dan's bold creation. His passion for unfiltered Weiss collides with Cascade Hops inventing our Imperial Hefe-Weizen. Dry hopping boldly rules over Wisconsin red wheat and our special strain of Bavarian yeast. At almost 20 O.P. this is the super mac daddy of Weiss beers. Decoction mashing was followed by excessive dry hopping to create a fierce onslaught of clove, cinnamon and citrus all in this living beer. Don't bother waiting to enjoy - the time is now."

For the second special edition of Julius brewed specifically for the third anniversary party, we pushed the level of citrus to the fringes of obscenity through additional kettle and dry hopping with the base Julius hop blend.

UPPER CASE has a delicate, dry pilsner malt character with a smooth, soft, doughy mouthfeel from the raw wheat, oily hop resin which all serves as a canvas for this twice dry hopped 9% double IPA. Overripe mango, pineapple and passion fruit aromas leap out as the beer is poured. The impression of tropical fruit also takes the lead in the flavor which is layered further by white wine, pine resin and grapefruit zest.

Not your typical ""Jelly of the Month Club"" beer. Dark roasted malt and bittersweet cocoa and coffee flavor and aroma burst from this pitch black milk stout.

Following an identical recipe but only changing one variable each time (the hop) we've been able to study the exact aromatics and flavours imparted by specific varieties. Not unlike the series launched by Mikkeller, here at Bellwoods our Monagamy brews are all about settling down with one love. Yes, when ordering this beer in the brewpub the jokes are endless (ie. “I'm not so sure about monogamy” or “I tried monogamy once and never really liked it” or the oft hilarious “I guess I'll have it because my girlfriend/boyfriend is sitting beside me”) but stop being a wise-ass.

Gggreennn!,Tree House Brewing Company,4.62,-,21,120,5.84%,21,19,0,Massachusetts,New England IPA,7.50%,Rotating,"
Green is an unequivocal crew favorite at Tree House. Over the years we have resisted the urge to brew GGGreennn as we have worked very hard to make Green the very best beer it can be with a carefully refined base beer and a very large kettle and dry hop additions. It's easy to overdo it, but over time we have learned how to adjust our process brewing the base beer to successfully accommodate a larger and larger hope additions without importing off putting characteristics. For GGGreennn, we pushed those principles to the extreme. The result is a richly hop saturated beer featuring notes of pineapple, guava, dried jackfruit, tropical fruit, and citrus. It carries a richness about it that is unique to classic Green, and yet never challenges or tires the palate. It is a pleasure to drink all the way through the glass. It is a beer we are proud to share with you, and hopefully it can serve to enhance a meaningful moment for you this summer."

Our Quadrupel is easily one of the most rich and full bodied beers we make, so when Paul Hayden at the Wine and Cheese Place in Clayton, Missouri asked us to age some in a bourbon barrel, we were happy to oblige. The resulting ale is loaded with oak and bourbon character, as well as the rich, dried fruit character of the Quadrupel. We have created a unique taste you will only find in this extremely limited edition. We filled just one bourbon barrel and may never produce this beer again, so enjoy!"

This is a very hop forward American style IPA. Brewed with Pale, Vienna, Munich and wheat malt for a solid base for all American hops, focusing mainly on the variety “Citra.” Citra hops are a relatively new variety introduced in 2008. It was bred as a hybrid of a number of different hops, including Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, U.S. Tettnanger, East Kent Golding, Bavarian, Brewers Gold, and other unknown hops. The resulting hop, Citra, has a distinct citrusy and tropical fruit flavor and aroma. In Citra ass down we used American Columbus for bittering and 11# of Citra at the end of the boil for late kettle addition flavor and aroma. Then we added 6 more pounds Citra and 5# Centennial post fermention for aroma. Rebrewed for your tasting pleasure!"

A luxurious mouthfeel and creamy body contribute to a beer that feels much bigger than it is - a decadent treat and one that won't overwhelm you with heaviness, yet is loaded with delicious bold flavors that express themselves as it warms. Life can come at us fast and hit us with unexpected hardship, inducing stress, fear, anger, confusion, sadness, and uncertainty. But together we must find solace and comfort in each other, and in something wonderful, equal, and free for everyone to hold on to - Sunshine. For Lauren."

It is aged in French oak and bottle conditioned. “Wee Heavy” is a brown-ruby rich color and has a sweet malt character."

Up until the Second World War, dark beer was the predominant beer type in the Munich area. The hard water found in the region played a special role in producing this specialty. In his book “Beer International”, the world-renowned English beer writer, Michael Jackson, accurately describes the Ayinger “Altbairisch Dunkel” as: “A good example of its kind. Impenetrably dark with a golden-brown gleam when held up to the light, and with a warm aroma and malty taste, while summoning up coffee taste sensations on going down. It is brewed from five types of malt (two of which are torrified dark), and it is only lightly hopped.” It is produced using the traditional double fermentation process."

12°,Selkirk Abbey Brewing Company,4.14,"#7,977",6,16,7.25%,2,1,0,Idaho,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.80%,Winter,"
The 2015 release of our abbey strong dark is very exciting for us. Like its cousin the abbey style dubbel, the origins of the abbey dark strong are lost in the distant past. It is likely that a beer was brewed for the Lenten season that was richer and more nourishing than the table beers normally brewed by the monks of the middle ages. The prevailing theory is that such a beer is the predecessor of the modern abbey style dubbel and dark strong. Selkirk Abbey’s 12° is our take on this modern classic. Eminently rich and inviting, 12° has resinous fruit notes, with deep toffee and caramel. The layers of seemingly endless malt yield ever so slightly to allow hints of Tabaco and leather in the finish."

18LB Porter,Georgetown Brewing Company,4.22,"#6,896",5,13,6.87%,1,3,0,Washington,American Porter,11.00%,Rotating,"
Last year, we short-filled the kettle to brew this imperial version of our Georgetown Porter. More roasty, more chocolately, more ABV and more delicious (if that’s even possible). Since then, the beer has been in first use Heaven Hills bourbon barrels, quietly waiting to be released into the world. Take all that roasty, chocolately goodness and add bourbon and vanilla notes from barrel aging, and you have a winter sipper sure to please."
Single Hop Series: All Cascade Pale Ale,COAST Brewing Company,4.16,"#4,464",24,44,8.89%,5,0,0,South Carolina,American Pale Ale (APA),5.50%,Rotating,"
Classic American Pale but also brewed with Munich, Wheat and Rye Malts for a smooth body and a bit of spiciness. Only Cascade hops were used throughout, from the boil to dry-hopping. Highly Hopped!"
Oaked Mosaic IPA,Community Beer Company,4.15,"#3,887",17,82,6.99%,2,16,0,Texas,American Imperial IPA,7.50%,Rotating,"
Barrel Aged Mosaic IPA!? Not quite. Aging a hop-focused beer in barrels will greatly diminish the hop aromas that we've toiled to create. Fortunately for us, we have the ability to add oak spirals- carefully milled helixes of toasted American oak to our aging tanks (and now Hop Gun!). This process infuses our beloved Mosaic IPA with delicious notes of oak, honey, vanilla, and coconut while preserving the beautiful hop profile."
Human Condition,Tree House Brewing Company,4.47,-,21,139,6.26%,13,25,2,Massachusetts,English Sweet / Milk Stout,7.90%,Rotating,"
Human Condition is a rich and delicious Tree House stout brewed with coconut, caramel and chocolate. It is designed to capture the spirit and flavor of samoas cookies. It pours a deep black color in the glass releasing aromas of tasted coconut, caramel, milk chocolate and creamy coffee. The flavor follows suit, with a predominant chocolate coconut note fading into a rich caramel candy finish. We are so pleased to our long running philosophy of presenting richly flavorful, thoughtful, and well crafted beers that neither tire or weigh heavy on the palate. This beer works perfectly as a companion to a cold spring evening spent dreaming of warm sandy beaches. In the breadth of the human condition we hope that this beer can offer a moment of joy amidst the endless ups and downs we encounter as we make our way through this fortunate journey called life."

Bitch Creek ESB was first brewed in 2003, and perfectly balances big malt sweetness and robust hop flavor for a full-bodied mahogany ale. It has quickly become our best-selling beer, as well as our most-critically acclaimed, having won medals-including two golds— at four out of the past five Great American Beer Festivals."

whitebugatti is the Triple version of our Galaxy/Citra DIPA whiteferrari. Clocking in at 11% this one is just freaking mind blowing. Seriously. We know we say things like this a lot, but we genuinely believe this is one of our most impressive, elegant, soft, expressive hoppy beers to date. If you like whiteferrari, you will go insane for this 11% soft bomb."
Son Of A Baptist,Epic Brewing Company,4.16,"#2,896",112,475,6.97%,19,81,2,Utah,American Imperial Stout,8.00%,Rotating,"
Son of a Baptist is an 8% ABV imperial stout. It is not barrel aged like its father, Big Bad Baptist; instead its flavor profile was designed to highlight the complex and often unique flavors of small batch coffees. Instead of sourcing a coffee that would play well in a beer we sought out creative and innovative roasters, then asked them which beans they’re passionate about. Each resulting release of Son of a Baptist is widely different depending on the coffee selected. Some are fruity and sweet with notes of jam and chocolate, others are rich and earthy with a big roasted finish. Each limited release will return to the Roaster’s home market where the beer and the coffee can be sampled side by side."

If you spend any time in Sheridan County someone local will tell you a different story about “Bomber Mountain”.

One of our flagship beers, slightly different in flavour every year! A splendid, maroon-coloured beer with fine aromas of spiced fruit, orange peel and well-roasted malt to delight the nose. The flavour is a spicy balance of caramel, citrus and slightly bitter hops to restore that warm feeling during the dark days of winter.

Is it a beer or dessert? A pleasant vanilla bean aroma beckons even the timid palate to sample this decadent porter. Dark roasted grains and substantial hopping add coffee notes and additional complexity across the palate. A slight raisiny and dark fruit character in the background help tame some of the bitterness and guides the beer into a long lasting roasted vanilla finish."

Bright - Nelson,Tree House Brewing Company,4.37,#591,54,347,7.09%,15,94,3,Massachusetts,American Imperial IPA,7.80%,Rotating,"
This batch of Bright was crafted to be a clean and elegant showcase for the notoriously awesome hop from New Zealand, Nelson Sauvin! It is crafted with a simple malt bill and fermented with clean American Ale yeast to create a flavor profile that is more a function of its vibrant fresh ingredients than an expression of yeast character. Bright w/Nelson’s aroma is a bounty of fresh citrus, grapefruit pith, and sauvignon blanc wine. The taste follows suit with notes of white wine, grapefruit and crushed gooseberry with a gentle earthy finish. She is dry, soft, and adequately bittered resulting in a very approachable intense Double IPA.. classic and delicious! Nelson!!"

Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast."

This beer was first brewed in 1978 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of our brewery. It has a golden-yellow color with a slightly flowery yeast, honey-ish aroma, tastes a little spicy and is full-bodied in initial taste, mild before swallowing and soft with a refined sparkle and fades with a well-balanced hint of bitterness. It is an especially drinkable and harmonious beer. Conrad Seidl, known as the Austrian “Pope of Beers”, on the Jahrhundert Bier: “It is a malty beer that pronounces the precious earthy quality of malted barley.”"

Pliny the Younger, the man, was Pliny the Elder’s nephew and adopted son. They lived nearly 2,000 years ago! Pliny the Elder is our Double IPA, so we felt it was fitting to name our Triple IPA after his son. It is almost a true Triple IPA with triple the amount of hops as a regular I.P.A. That said, it is extremely difficult, time and space consuming, and very expensive to make. And that is why we don’t make it more often! This beer is very full-bodied with tons of hop character in the nose and throughout. It is also deceptively well-balanced and smooth."

Mosaic Fresh Hop IPA is brewed with fresh Mosaic hops, picked fresh off the vine and immediately shipped to the brewery and put into the beer. Hops grow in a way to protect the Lupulin glands, which produce the hop flavors we love. Hops are traditionally pelletized which lock in the majority of oils for long term storage but removes some of the delicate flavors they can offer. Fresh hopped beers are a way for brewers to use hops in their purest form. Enjoy this farm fresh beer in fall just weeks after the hop harvest."

The Original Schlenkerla Lentbeer is an unfiltered smokebeer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516. Bottom-fermenting yeast gives the reddish brown lentbeer a natural cloudiness. Its smokey aroma is already noticeable in the smell, combined with a fine hoppy note. In the drink the fullbodied, highly drinkable lentbeer shows its strong malty flavour, rounded up with the smokey taste and a light bitterness. Due to the nourishing yeast, the Original Schlenkerla Lentbeer has the ""Brotzeit already included"" (German word for afternoon snack)."

We don’t blame you if you don’t believe us, but this beer was born in a dream. Sean arrived at the brewery one day, having woken from a dream where we brewed two beers. One was made with boiled peanuts, and the other with pecans. For logistical reasons, among others, we decided we had to make with ones with pecans. After sourcing 150 lbs of them, we split them up amongst ourselves, roasting every last nut in our respective home ovens. 5 pounds of those home-roasted pecans were added per barrel of this American brown ale, imparting a great nutty nose that presents itself more as the beer warms up."

On the surface, ÜberJoe lives up to its name sake: it’s a big coffee beer. But as with most things at 3 Sheeps, the story behind the beer is more complex. From the full-flavored roast we developed with Colectivo Coffee, to the vanilla we add post-fermentation, to our partnership with Black Swan Cooperage and their unique “honeycomb” cut barrel staves that produce a deeper barrel flavor than typical staves — everything in Uber Joe is designed to highlight its massive coffee flavor. It may be more time consuming, sure, and more expensive, but the end result is worth it. It’s a chocolatey, vanilla stout with notes of sweet baked bread, bourbon, maple candy and all of the coffee flavor you can handle."

It is unfiltered, naturally carbonated, and double dry hopped. Intensely aromatic and saturated with resinous hop flavor, this is the ale that I dream to have shared with Ephraim. "

Brewing is the craft of blending science with artistry then introducing the mystical. Field to Ferment exempliﬁes this adventure. We will brew this fresh hop ale throughout the entire hop harvest in Yakima using each of four hop varieties as they are harvested. At least that’s the plan. Nature may have a different plan. Such is the harvest. Each can has a date and brew number stamped on the bottom; check FremontBrewing.com for the exact hops used in your beer. In order of harvest, we will brew with fresh Centennial, Simcoe,™ Citra,™ and ﬁnally Mosaic™ hops. Field to Ferment represents a colossal collaboration between the brewery and our hop farmers. No one has attempted to brew fresh hop beers throughout the entire season. We will make countless trips between the ﬁelds in Yakima and the brewery in Fremont, loaded with tens of thousands of pounds of fresh, juicy hops. Nothing is fresher, nothing is better for a brewer. So, please do enjoy this beer absolutely fresh, and enjoy the adventure this beer represents…Because Fresh Hop Beer Matters! “Fresh hops are the best hops.” – VWP"

Like most whiskey aficionados, we also love a great beer. And in particular we became very fond of barrel aged beers, which from time to time had been aged in our whiskey barrels! So, we decided to have some fun and make our own beer. We partnered with a great brewery (the Beltway Brewing Co. in Sterling, VA) and began ""working"" with their master brewer to create a unique recipe with a flavor profile that would develop best in barrels that previously held our award winning James E. Pepper 1776 Rye Whiskey. No more than 30 days after our whiskey barrels are dumped in Kentucky, they are at the brewery being filled with beer. This ensures that every batch gets a big, boozy Rye whiskey finish and notes of toffee, chocolate, oak & vanilla."

India Pale Ales are distinguished by an eminent hop flavor, bitterness and aroma. Royale 41 is no exception to the rule. This Imperial IPA acquires its stately title from the 41st parallel – the latitudinal mark that runs through our brewery in the Northern Hemisphere and the hop-growing region of New Zealand in the Southern Hemisphere. Loaded with American and New Zealand hops, and fermented with an American yeast, this is a union fit for nobility."

Southern Pecan Nut Brown Ale is the first beer in the world, to our knowledge, made with whole roasted pecans. The pecans are used just like grain and provide a nutty characteristic and a delightful depth to the flavor profile. This beer is very lightly hopped to allow the malty, caramel, and nutty flavors shine through. The color is dark mahogany. Southern Pecan won a Bronze Medal in the 2006 World Beer Cup in the Specialty Beer category."

The amburana aged recipe was done backwards: instead of ageing a regular beer in barrels, we designed a beer especially for one of a kind amburana barrels. For this specialty beer we added candy sugar and used lager yeast. We applied a high toast to the wood used in the barrel's construction, which conceals the alcohol perception of the beer."

Damon (1993-2004) The time spent with loved ones, now lost, seems to affect our mind and body perpetually: memories happen upon us, unsuspectingly, and bring about tears of fond remembrance. Damon was our brother – devout and patient in an age of busyness and distraction. In his honor, we crafted and conditioned this Imperial Stout in bourbon barrels from our favorite distillery. We still reflect, daily, upon our Damon and his scruffy chin of grey – of his loyalty and his love."

This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Georgy Zhukov, arguably one of the finest generals of World War II. Opaque black in color, with notes of espresso, chocolate, dark toffee and hints of backstrap molasses.

Mattina Rossa is a beer that was a long time in the making. It was brewed in August of 2008 with a base of 2-Row malt and 440 lbs of local raspberries in the mash. It was then conservatively hopped with Tettanang, German Tradition and Saaz and fermented with our house yeast strain. Shortly after primary fermentation, the beer was racked into eleven red wine barrels, nine of which were inoculated with either Lactobacillus or Brettanomyces ""Allagensis"". After one year, we placed an additional 100 lbs of local raspberries in five of the barrels. The beer continued to age for an additional year, at which time the barrels were blended to strike the desired balance of fruit and funk."

Moment of Clarity is an American Milk Stout carefully brewed and conditioned with coffee, chocolate, and dark amber maple syrup. It pours beautifully in the glass with a rich, mousse-like head and dense complexion. It exhibits strong maple and chocolate aromas on the nose and recalls chocolate covered maple cream candies in the flavor. Though dense and flavor filled, it still maintains a certain fluffiness that makes it easy and pleasant to drink a big glass of. It is a wonderful and decadent treat that, for us, evokes a yearning for relaxed Sunday mornings with a pile of chocolate chip pancakes."

Being located in the biggest wheat producing state in the nation, a refreshing wheat beer is a must-brew. The Wheat State Golden is usually our lightest beer.

There is just a touch of caramel malt to add the golden color, and the rest is pale malt. The Golden is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle for bittering, and Hallertau Hersbrucker hops for aroma."

The Quad,Free State Brewing Co.,4,"#12,497",3,17,10.25%,1,2,0,Kansas,Belgian Quadrupel (Quad),8.50%,Rotating,"
Our interpretation does not disappoint. Belgian Candi sugar added to the kettle augments an already large malt bill consisting of nine different malts. Subtle hop additions of Perle and Czech Saaz contribute bitterness and a hint of spiciness. This beer underwent a secondary fermentation in the conditioning vessel after a small dose of Candi sugar and yeast were added to the finished beer. This secondary fermentation is what gives the Quad its carbonation and mouthfeel. It all finishes off with a noticeable presence of alcohol that marries well with the spicy notes and equates into a complex brew not so easily solved from the first drink."

We've all come to know and love our barrel-aged sour rye ale, Sour in the Rye. Now it's time to enjoy a bright variation of it that has kumquats added to the mix. Not only is ""kumquat"" one of the most fun fruit names to roll off the tongue, it also treats the entire palate to a unique display of fruity characteristics. The tart, sweet, citrus and tropical notes of both the kumquats and tangerine zest strike a balance with the honey, vanilla and woody character imparted from barrel-aging. At the same time, the unique bitterness of the citrus fruit locks step with the clove and pepper notes imparted from the rye."

“Schlenkerla Helles” is brewed with fine Bavarian aroma hops from the area around the city of Nürnberg. It's lagered in century old caves underneath the historic Schlenkerla brewery and maltings.

Its subtle smokiness without using smoke malt makes “Helles Schlenkerla Lager” a unique representative of the classic lager beer style “Bavarian Helles”."

“Can I scream….” for more hops? You sure can.

As to what Lambda was doing while on sabbatical for a year, it’s tough to say. Perhaps it was reading post apocalyptic fiction, or just diabolically planning its return…"

Aged in the third-use barrels that were once home to Kentucky bourbon and then our renowned Bourbon County Stout, this traditional English-style barleywine possesses the subtlety of flavor that only comes from a barrel that’s gone through many seasons of ritual care. The intricacies of the previous barrel denizens – oak, charcoal, hints of tobacco and vanilla, and that signature bourbon heat – are all present in this beer. Hearty and complex, Bourbon County Brand Barleywine is a titan and a timeline; a bold, flavorful journey through the craft of barrel aging."

A beer that has a dominant malty taste. This beer’s origins in a monk’s recipe are reflected in its heartiness. The Pope of Beers, Conrad Seidl, describes it as: “Almost black with a very slight red tone, a sensational, festive foam and truly extraordinary fragrance that at first summons up visions of greaves lard. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste. There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous medals."

Making its return migration to New England, Big Bird remains one of our hoppiest beers ever. Drawing inspiration from our “small birds” by utilizing speciality grains and unique hop varieties, Big Bird has an amped profile worthy of a larger fowl. Pouring a noticeably cloudy yellow, this intensely aromatic Double IPA conjures up a tropical fruit cocktail nose of fresh pressed orange and ripe pineapple with a garnish of lemon and light spruce tip spice. Strong citrus flavors of key lime pie, mandarin orange, and tangy grapefruit pith lead into a creamy profile of kiwi flesh, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon with papaya. Medium bodied, Big Bird’s tropical sweetness on the front of the palate is balanced out on the finish by a soft herbal bitterness. Don’t sleep on this bird, it’s one for the books!"

In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country, home to more than 45 breweries. Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original."

It is heavy with citrus character, with threads of papaya, guava, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and stone fruit. The finish is quite soft and features a texture unique to Tree House. It’s a beer that makes us yearn for warmer weather and the feeling of a late afternoon sunset."

Last year for our 4th Anniversary, we wanted to brew something extra special and deeply rooted in Trillium's history. Congress Street was the very first IPA we brewed in 2013. Its success inspired an entire series of beers, all named after streets in Fort Point surrounding our first brewery. Each of these beers uses the same base recipe featuring a different dry hop presenting a unique flavor with common ties. Building off of the Streets series, we decided to brew a beer that was a little bit of each. Using the same base recipe as all our Street beers, we dry hopped with Amarillo, Mosaic, Galaxy, El Dorado, Simcoe, Nelson, Vic Secret, & Enigma. This year's recipe of The Streets Triple IPA is a celebratory culmination of all the Streets beers we've brewed over the past 5 years, and our continued exploration of fermentation profiles. "

At the end of 2014, determined to increase our production, we acquired a new building.

Hundreds of barrels, coming from various origins in France and Italy, most having contained red wine beforehand, thus came to furnish our new location. Among them, three origins stood out : those that had held Sangiovese, Amarone and Chianti. "

Maharaja,Avery Brewing Company,4.23,"#1,643","1,888","5,721",10.17%,396,908,7,Colorado,American Imperial IPA,10.20%,Rotating,"
Maharaja is derived from the sanskrit words mahat, meaning “great”, and rajan, meaning “king”. Much like its namesake, this imperial IPA is regal, intense and mighty. With hops and malts as his servants, he rules both with a heavy hand. The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant and pungent along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. Welcome to his kingdom!"

The number of fans and friends of Bayern Brewing has steadily been increasing out in Eastern Montana. Bayern Brewing wanted to recognize the hard-working folks who are ""Rockin’ the Bakken"" by honoring them with our own black gold, a German Dark Doppelbock called ""Bakken Bock."" Bayern Brewing has been brewing authentic Bavarian beers like its award-winning Doppelbock for over 20 years. Bakken Bock is a lager, so it is smooth and does not have the rough bite and/or aftertaste of other dark beers such as stouts or porters. It is also moderately-hopped with German Hallertauer Perle and Czech Saaz hops, so it is a well-balanced treat after a hard day on the oil fields. Of course, with a starting gravity of 18+ degrees Plato and an 8.4% ABV, it means you really ought to heed that warning about no operating heavy machinery after drinking Bakken Bock."

Positive Contact is the second batch of the Imperial Belgian-Style Wheat beer that Sam and Ben brewed a couple months back. For this batch, we stepped up the spice and cider additions. Instead of 200 lbs of apples, Ben pressed 300 lbs of organic Fuji apples for a total addition of 25 gallons of fresh pressed cider, which was added to the whirlpool in order to really bring out the cider character. The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices. Lastly, this batch was boiled for less time than the original batch, leaving the beer with a lighter straw color than the amberish hue of batch #1."

Odin's Tipple was meant to be a strong beer, but we changed our minds...its still strong but we wont follow the mega strong trend. It should be possible to make great beer without the extreme alcohol potency. Odins Tipple is now approx 11% abv, it’s a dark almost black beer from lots and lots of chocolate malt. Its the malt that contributes the flavor...no added coffee or anything else, Its got a great body without being old engine oil and still very drinkable due to the wild yeast we use. This beer is made with a single strain of wild yeast and the recipe is dead simple."

We took the 4 cherry varieties we had left over from the 2016 season and added them to vintage barrels of Funky Blender for refermentation. The result is more acid forward compared to Cherry Fruit Stand. The sweet and sour cherries work great together. "

The local wildflower honey keeps the body light and drinkable but provides a floral, earthy backbone. Juicy, candied peach and nectarine up front backed up with a nuanced white wine on the nose that continues straight through in the flavor profile.

IPA,Lucky Bucket Brewing Co.,3.66,"#31,388",82,263,13.93%,3,39,0,Nebraska,American IPA,6.30%,Year-round,"
India Pale Ale is about balance. The right balance of malt, hop flavor, bitterness, and aroma to create an unforgettable ale. Lucky Bucket's Original American IPA begins with a nice malt bill that lets the brew stand up to the mountain of hops added later. After the boil, the hot wort (the beer before it's really beer) is fired through a hop back, a unique four-barrel stainless steel tank filled with a gratuitous amount of raw flower Amarillo, Centennial, and Cascade hops, extracting the aromatic oils and flavor of the hops. Followed with additional dry hopping in the fermenter, the end result is a big, well-balanced West Coast-style IPA with terrific hop flavor and aroma. Lucky Bucket IPA weighs in at 65 IBUs and 6.3% ABV."

The Juice,Madison River Brewing Company,3.77,"#23,561",17,69,13%,1,13,0,Montana,American Imperial IPA,9.00%,Year-round,"
This Double India Pale Ale, or IPA, is extremely hopped American-style Ale that gets its hop bitterness and character from Amarillo and Simcoe hops. A generous amount of hops and malt, 3.5 lbs per barrel and 2800 lbs of malt, were used to give this beer a rich malt character with a distinctive hop flavor and aroma. This unfiltered beer is amber colored, thick bodied, highly bitter, and finishes off with a sweet grapefruit after taste."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,AleSmith Brewing Company,4.5,#159,184,"1,923",6.67%,527,298,27,California,American Imperial Stout,12.00%,Rotating,"
This Vietnamese coffee version of Speedway Stout is and continues to be AleSmith's most popular variation of the ever-growing Speedway Stout collection. Since 2012 we have been adding this blend of four Vietnamese coffees, known in Vietnam as cà phê sa đá, to our popular imperial stout. The coffee beans were slowly roasted at low temperatures and then brewed by AleSmith with a traditional phin-style filter that gently percolates water through the ground coffee. The result is an intensely aromatic and bold tasting coffee that complements the notes of chocolate and roast in this massive stout."

The Crusher is an American Double IPA that I started making years ago at the old pub. Hop heads were constantly asking for more hops. So, in the words of Frank Zappa, ""Did you say you want some more? Well here's some more."" While I enjoy hops with the rest of them, I still try to maintain some semblance of balance and drinkability. This beer is oozing with hop flavor and aroma with a very dry finish. Enjoy responsibly, this one can sneak up on you."

Beer For Breakfast Stout,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,3.94,"#10,757",187,777,10.15%,35,175,3,Delaware,English Sweet / Milk Stout,7.40%,Rotating,"
20 years ago when Sam was first cooking up ideas for brews (literally) for his soon to be brewpub, one of the first concoctions tested and implemented was Chicory Stout, a breakfast-themed beer with Mexican Coffee, Chicory, and Licorice root. 20 years later, we’ve brewed a supped up mac-daddy version of this OG Dogfish brew to commemorate the anniversary of Chicory, aptly named Beer for Breakfast. We took the original Chicory recipe, doubled the grain bill to hit 10% ABV, and tricked it out with all other sorts of delicious Breakfast-minded ingredients including lactose sugar (the sugar that lends Milk Stouts their character); barley malt smoked over local Fifer Orchards wood; maple syrup harvested from trees at Northfield Mount Hermon, the Western Massachusetts school where Sam and wife Mariah met; Steve’s Smokey Double Dark roast coffee from J & S Bean Factory in St. Paul Minnesota (a special nod to one of Sam’s favorite bands – The Replacements, who hail from Minnesota and wrote one of Sam’s most beloved songs: Beer for Breakfast); and for the quintessential Delaware breakfast touch – 25 pounds of Rapa Scrapple, which was added to the mash. Huge notes of coffee in the nose give way to sweet, smokey, and savory layers in the flavor which overlap bittersweet chocolate, roasty espresso, and malty undertones. We don’t have much of this one, so come and get it while it lasts!"

And though it’s our highest alcohol beer to date, you’ll find the beauty is in the balance."

Over the ages the term ’cellar door’ has numerously been referred to as the most beautiful term in the English language. Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish."

When poured into the glass you will instantly sense that Hr. Frederiksen is a gentleman with both potency and a huge personality. Dark as Hr. Frederiksen's humor, this imperial stout is inspired by the American imperial stouts with it's dense and creamy light brown head that leaves nice lacings in the glass while the head reluctantly dissipates. We are willing to admit that we went crazy with the malts in this beer. A massive 8 different types of malts were used, and it is the dark and heavily roasted ones that give the beer it's color and almost extreme full body - this is almost a meal in a bottle. The bitterness is also delivered by the heavily roasted malts backed up by the American Centennial hops. Oh yes, Hr. Frederiksen is an experience which should be enjoyed slowly, but in return he will last all night warming you with his alcohol and challenging charm. We have named this beer after a good friend, without whom, Amager Bryghus would not be what it is today."

Reposé,Jester King Brewery,4.21,"#2,145",25,243,7.13%,33,56,11,Texas,French Bière de Garde,8.30%,Rotating,"
The inspiration for Reposé came from dusty, hay-filled barns like the one near Jester King where we store our aged hops. We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. "

As Citra’s wave rolled across the land from the west coast we waited… and waited. Finally it crested, and a sample crashed into our pilot system. After brewing with it all the buzz made sense. Comments ranged from “Well that changes the game” to “It’s so good it feels like we’re cheating.” Today we procure as much as Citra as we can to bring you as much of this IPA as our little brewery can muster.

Brinkley's Maibock,Free State Brewing Co.,3.6,"#34,205",24,78,10.28%,2,16,0,Kansas,German Maibock,6.50%,Spring,"
This beer has a very full and complex flavor that is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the different flavors time to develop on your tongue. You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau."

Avancé is a strong, sour ale with aromas of strawberry preserves and toasted oak. Berries and more oak continue in the flavor, which concludes with a warm, sweet finish. The beer is brewed with multiple sugars including molasses, date sugar, white cane sugar, and dark rock candi. It’s then fermented with three different yeast strains and aged in oak bourbon barrels for a year with Lactobacillus and Pediococcus.

Regular Coffee,Carton Brewing Company,4.23,"#1,731",100,631,9.93%,261,111,4,New Jersey,American Cream Ale,12.00%,Rotating,"
A Classic Jersey-ism is ""regular coffee."" Here when you oder a ""regular coffee"" at any place you trust to make a pork roll and cheese you get a paper cup of coffee with ""milk and 2 sugars"" rather than a ""black coffee that hasn't had the caffeine removed."" Acidic bitter coffee flattened by milk and sweetened; the perfect foil for the salty unctuous savor of breakfast on a roll. For our homage to Jersey's breakfast beverage, we teamed up with our neighbors at Fair Mountain Coffee Roasters looking for an elevated version of classic crappy coffee. We chose Mexican Chiapas for its bitterness akin to artichoke, roasting it a little darker than usual, along with Ethiopian Sidamo for its pleasant lemon-like acidity, which we pushed up through fermentation. We added this coffee blend to a high gravity golden cream ale, contributing our ""milk and 2 sugars."" Drink Regular Coffee because running over a black beer with coffee is no way to get to work."

This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Georgy Zhukov, arguably one of the finest generals of World War II.

Freshly roasted coffee beans and vanilla were added to this juggernaut of an imperial stout, the only style of beer bold and strong enough to share its name with The Marshall himself. "

Saison Blue,Dragoon Brewing Co.,4.01,"#10,573",4,27,6.73%,0,6,0,Arizona,Belgian Saison,7.10%,Summer,"
In the spirit of traditional Belgian farmhouse ales, Saison Blue is brewed mostly from malted barley but with sizable contributions from regional ingredients (traditionally wheat, spelt, or buckwheat). In our case, we happen to use blue corn and blue agave nectar. It is then lightly dry-hopped with American and European hops for a bright, herbal and floral finish. To us, it represents a link between old-world brewing traditions and new-world processes and ingredients. At the end of the day, this beer is bone dry, light bodied and quite refreshing, but features a spicy, complex flavor and aroma profile."

It is made from a simple malt bill: North American base and pale caramel malt. We use copious amounts of Northwest hops (Summit, Columbus, Magnum and Zythos) all throughout the boil, with most of it going in within the last 15 minutes. After fermentation is complete, we dry hop it with approximately 1 boatload of each of the same hop varieties."

We don't have many rules at Carton Brewing and those we have we made up for ourselves. In general though, we strive for drinkability through balance and harmonization of flavors. But even self-imposed rules are meant to be broken. With Epitome we decided to embrace the teenage metalhead in each of us and get discordant with a seriously hoppy, high gravity, black ale. The only notions accepted were to make it bigger, bolder, hotter & faster. A Beast. The ABV had to push past 10, the black had to be ""none more,"" and the hops had to be American and piled on like a double bass drum kicking faster and harder. Drink Epitome because things worth doing are worth over doing."

To celebrate our 10th Year Anniversary in 2009, Ken wanted to put out a hoppy, bitter brew as a witty way to commemorate a decade of survival in the craft brewing industry. The result? Our 10 Bitter Years Imperial IPA. This strong brew pours a burnt orange colour and has a fresh, bright citrus and tropical fruit aroma. This beer is double dry hopped using three different varieties of North American hops leading to a full flavour of bitter pine and citrus. Although it packs a good hoppy punch, it finishes as smooth as possible for the style, with just enough alcohol warmth to enhance the flavour. "

We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993. There were some great IPAs out in the Pacific Northwest, but no local IPAs on the east coast.

We place a base brew crafted with 60% wheat grist in 600L oak puncheons for 3 months with fermentation duties shared gracefully between lactobacillus and our Native New England mixed culture. Loosely inspired by the cold-maceration process used in winemaking, we blend fruit directly into the barrels to “soak” for enhanced extraction of unique colors, aromatics, and flavors. Delightfully acidic, but not funky, our Soak series is an approachable sequence of wild offerings that we are proud to share. Raspberries bring an assertively tart, yet unsweetened flavor profile, striking crimson hue, and re-enforced tannic structure. Raspberry Soak is dry with undertones of oak and wheat."

A Perry-Pils hybrid, Piercing Pils is a Czech Style Pilsner brewed with a White Pear Tea and Pear juice.

Amarillo hops add nuanced citrus notes that meld perfectly with the fruit."

Porter was first brewed in London, England in the early 1700’s. At the time two basic beers existed: a light and a dark. The dark was more expensive and drinkers got into the habit of mixing the two to stretch out the premium brew. A wise brewer began making a medium dark beer to save the barkeeps from having to mix at the taps. The beer was named after its biggest fans: the porters handling baggage at the local train stations. This brown porter is deep ruby in color and transluscent."

Too many strive towards complacency as a goal. We grow up thinking that the ability to become complacent is the equivalence of success in life.

The Wolf - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3 Sheeps Brewing,4.3,"#1,568",22,75,6.98%,1,21,2,Wisconsin,American Imperial Stout,13.50%,Rotating,"
This beer is a bit dangerous. It’s packed with flavor — rich bourbon, warm wood tannins, and notes of sweet caramel and chocolate. Yet it’s so easy-drinking that you won’t notice the 13.5% ABV. Yes, 13.5%. The Wolf is a simple beer at heart, a classic imperial stout with a robust malt bill, but has a science-y trick up its sleeve. We treated the alcohol sweetness as an ingredient instead of an afterthought, using it to to harness the strong bourbon notes and maintain the beer’s light body. The result? The liquid equivalent of a wolf in sheep’s clothing."

We love the Bright series for its individualism as it allows the pure character of the hop to shine, foregoing the hop compound biotransformation that contributes depth, complexity, and originality to our core Tree House IPA’s.

Alpha Pale Ale derives its name from the alpha acids in hops which, added early in the boil, impart a distinctive bitterness. Cascade and Amarillo hops are used to make this beer. Hops are added early and late in the boil and then dry hopped in late fermentation. They contribute a wonderfully complex fruit and citrus aroma. Pale malts round off this beer with a fuller malt character."

The 2016 release of Dusk till Dusk is a blend of eight hand selected barrels of our most imperial stout aged in a variety of rum and bourbon barrels for 6-18 months. It offers huge aromas of plum, dried fig, cedar box, and dark cocoa. The mouthfeel is ultra silky with flavors of brown sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and dark chocolate. With just enough residual sugar to balance out the higher ABV of 13.8%, it's decadence in a glass. These are some layers that you can really sink your teeth into!"

Why Double Knot for a name? Well, it's essentially a double Hop Knot. Now does that mean we just went and doubled the alcohol content? No, but close; Hop Knot is around 6% and Double Knot is around 9.2%. So, did we double the hops? Well, yes! We did! Hop Knot uses around 3.5 lbs per barrel and Double Knot is around 7.5 lbs per barrel (Okay, a little more than double, don't sue us). That's really the main difference between the two; slightly higher alcohol content and twice the hops. But what a difference if you're a true hop-head."

Our light-coloured, spicy single-bock, “Vitus” is saturated with fine yeast and a creamy foam. It is a specialty with a round character based on the extra long storage time. The fruity smell of dried apricots joins aromas of citrus, cloves and hints of banana. Full-bodied and sparkling with an effervescent mouthfeel. Thus, the Vitus does not taste like a typical Bock beer but more like a noble, fruity wheat beer. Perfect with red meat, strong cheese and also able to guide desserts. Brewed according to our centuries-old brewing tradition on the Weihenstephan hill."

This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England.

Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces."

""Small"" Imperial Stout. This is a malt-centric beer so hops are not the feature. This is ""Son of Berserker"" - second runnings, usually called ""small beer"", of Berserker Imperial Stout. So at 8% ABV, ""small"" is relative--literally, as this little guy is the son of a great beer. No oak aging. But taste iT. This beer is completely incredible."

Detritivore was made by adding the same cherries that were used to make Montmorency vs. Balaton to fresh beer in stainless steel and allowing the combined beer and fruit to referment to dryness. This was the same technique that we originally used to make La Vie en Rose with the raspberries from Atrial Rubicite. As with La Vie en Rose, the second refermentation of the fruit results in subtler, more delicate flavors, as compared with the more intense flavors that result from the initial refermentation."

This funk jam began in stainless as a mixed fermentation with Vermont Ale yeast and Brett D from our friends at Escarpment Labs. After primary, it was transferred to a single new (to us) red wine foeder where it spent a year developing heavy pineapple and leather funk notes from the Brett, as well as some subtle oak and wine character. The whole batch then went back into stainless where it conditioned on top of 1,200kg of apricot puree, followed by a generous Mosaic & Citra dry hop. Unlike our most recent Barn Owl releases, this version is not a sour — it is heavy on brett induced funk, paired with a heavy blanket of fresh apricot skin."

NoDa Brewing will release four-pack cans of Hop Cakes, a double IPA brewed with maple syrup, at the taproom this Monday, Feb. 9. The cans will be distributed around town starting the next day, but if you want to try it on tap head to the brewery this Friday, Feb. 6 (kegs, too, will make their way to area bars next week). This beer first appeared as a small-batch NoDable beer almost three years ago when head brewer Chad Henderson interrupted a lumberjack convention to tell them about the beer. The brewery has since brewed larger amounts and had it on tap at the brewery, though not often. This will be the first time they have packaged the beer. This is the second in the brewery’s line of specialty cans. The first, Hoppy Holidays, was released last December. Though it was distributed to many bottle shops around town, Hoppy Holidays didn’t last long on the shelves. At more than 3,000 four-packs, Hop Cakes will be much more plentiful than Hoppy Holidays. Still, it’s limited. I’d recommend trying to find it sooner rather than later, as it’s sure to sell like — well, you know."

Persimmon is a native species of fruit bearing tree in North America. Paired with Peach and Pineapple, these fruits come together in wonderful harmony, with each delivering their own wonderful flavors and aromas on a foundation. Dry hopped with Galaxy, inviting aromas of passionfruit and citrus hop character meet the nose alongside rich fruit notes of banana, pear, peach and mango. Flavor is mildly tart, with rich peachy tropical notes balanced with delicate hops. Finish is dry, with lingering Galaxy impact. (On Bottle) No two foeders are the same. Each of our eleven foeders create subtle nuances of unique flavors that are typically blended together before aging on additional ingredients. This sour ale is different. Luminary explores the beer fermented in a single foeder, Twiggy Sawdust. One of the first foeders we aquired, Twiggy Sawdust showcases flavors of ripe peaches and pear with a distinct lactic acid character. We then aged the base beer on Pineapple, Peach and Persimmon fruits, and dry-hopped with Galaxy hops, creating a sour ale with tropical fruit flavors and a mild mild funk character."

This very special beer was brewed as a double strength imperial stout with an original gravity of 27.5P/ 1118. The hopping level is very hard to define. Though there are enough hops to achieve 100 IBUs in a smaller beer, this beer still has a distinct sweetness due to a high percentage of unfermentable sugars. After fermentation, this beer is aged in old whiskey barrels from the McCormick's bottling plant in Weston, MO, hence the name Owd Mac's (""owd"" being a British regional colloquialism for old)."

This sad holiday season we didn’t have the brewing capacity to make our favorite seasonal brew, the widely feared BrownShugga’ Ale. You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin’ along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever. We freaking munch moldy donkey butt and we just want it to be all over... "

Bigfoot is a beast of a beer, brimming with bold flavors of bittersweet malt and heaps of aggressive whole-cone Pacific Northwest hops. First introduced in the winter of 1983, Bigfoot is a cult-classic beer brewed in the barleywine style, meaning a strong, robust, bruiser of a beer with the refined intensity of a wine. Bigfoot is prized by beer collectors for its supreme cellarability. Under the proper conditions, it can age like a fine wine, developing new flavors and character as it matures in the bottle. Each new release or “expedition” is vintage dated. Collect your own and see the flavors develop and progress."

On the eve of our first anniversary, I brewed another beer for Lauren, In Perpetuity. It hopes to celebrate foreverness - in love, passion, and regardless of circumstance - the notion that what is good and beloved will last forever. In Perpetuity is brewed with a simple malt bill and two of my favorite hops - Citra, and Nelson. It pours a hazy bright orange in the glass and mixes notes of tropical fruit with a strong citrus backbone. Soft, and eminently drinkable. I hope you enjoy it. "

Chicken Killer Barley Wine is the revolutionary beer that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style. It is brewed with twice the ingredients of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's other beers, and only half the usual amount of liquid is extracted from these ingredients. This makes one substantial beer. At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city. If you did not have the opportunity to try last year's vintage, come try this year's!"

Big, malty and dark, Draken Robust porter exudes a roasty aroma from its tan head. You’ll taste a complex and rich chocolate and caramel malt character followed by a touch of warmth and light malt sweetness. Draken has subtle flavors of raisins and dark fruits and a touch of hop bitterness to balance the flavor on the palate. Despite its dark appearance, the beer is medium-bodied with a wonderful mouthfeel that allows the rich flavors to linger on your tongue just long enough to last until the next sip."

Abstraction - Coffee,Tree House Brewing Company,4.43,-,4,19,6.09%,0,3,0,Massachusetts,American Imperial Porter,8.80%,Limited (brewed once),"
Our friends at Gracenote are masters at the art, science, and complexity of coffee roasting, tasting, and extraction. For this beauty, we worked in conjunction with them to select a coffee that would perfectly support and complement Abstraction. Given the characteristics of the base beer, we selected a coffee with solid structure and complexity, and with firm acidity to provide lift and balance (Kenya Kavutiri AB). The result is truly greater than the sum of its parts. It tastes like the most beautifully harmonious cup of coffee we’ve ever had, with virtually no bitterness, and densely packed coffee flavors. It is richly flavorful without weighing down the palate, and it finishes cleanly and boldly. It challenges and rewards the palate as it is allowed to warm in the glass. We are very excited to share this beer with you as it represents everything we try to achieve as craftsman - balance, elegance, authenticity, and rich flavor that is enjoyable pint after pint, time and time again, in any circumstance. Enjoy!"

We live in Las Vegas and enjoy the areas beyond the reach of the neon. Bootleg Canyon MTB Park is one of those places. Be Warned, the rattlers have just as much bite as this ale.

2014 saw the creation and evolution of one of our proudest accomplishments here at Tree House: Double Shot. Over the year we often wondered how far we could push the coffee and still maintain a balanced and delightful beer. In the spirit of maintaining the integrity and refinement of the original Double Shot, we created a new base beer to withstand precisely double the coffee addition Double Shot receives to satisfy our curiosity. The result is something quite surprising and completely original! More milk chocolate than coffee, and more brown sugar than molasses, Triple Shot conveys a super unique flavor profile that explodes with complexity as it warms. The crew here tastes “straight chocolate syrup”, ”chocolate covered raspberries”, “sweet espresso”, and “chocolate Charleston Chew (seriously)”. A truly rich treat that begs to be shared - we’re psyched to shared it with YOU!"
